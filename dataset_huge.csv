Occasionally I work on a project only to scrap it so I wanted to show you one example. From the outside it may appear that a developer is some genius guy who can make whatever he wants. Although this is partially true (engineering is magic), many of you don't see all of the time spent just thinking and reading... All of the footage I capture is usually the by-product of countless hours of thinking. Over the past month I've worked on many new things - react, I2C driver programming and containerization with docker. It's just reminded me how large the technology stack is and everyone is a beginner at some level of the stack. I feel like I haven't made much progress in the past month because I've been a beginner at a lot of new things :) This is the reality and I needed a YouTube vid so I figured I would talk about it.

ReVeUvwTGdU,programming,youtube#video,2018-07-24T17:00:13.000Z,UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA,3 years of Computer Science in 8 minutes,"This is the most asked question on my channel by far so I thought I'd explain how I learned programming. In the process I got a little distracted and accidentally explained all of computer science in 8 minutes (kind of). 

The goal of this video was to show you the connections between modern day (high-level) programming and how it was implemented at the low level. I show you the basics in Java and convert it to C code, then into Assembly, which leads me to talk about how computers perform addition/subtraction, and the logic design behind that is all implemented with transistors. In case you couldn't tell, I love low level programming. Just a disclaimer that I'm not saying this is the best way to learn programming I am simply sharing what I feel was the most valuable in my learning so far. I know many people start with web technologies which can be a great introduction as well! I am currently teaching myself a lot of server networking & all that stuff. I just believe if you really want to understand how to design algorithms and solve problems in creative ways then the most valuable things you can learn are at the low level. Even though C is 40 years old it is still regarded as producing the most efficient code since you have full control over pointers and memory management with minimal overhead. (the only thing faster is assembly.. an even lower level)

So far the most intense ranking I've ever done :) For recent years I've used multiple programming languages popularity indexes with adjustments thanks to the data from GitHub repositories access frequency. For historical ranking I've used aggregation of multiple national surveys to establish several data points, plus a world wide publications rate of occurrence. In this ranking popularity is defined by percentage of programmers with either proficiency in specific language or currently learning/mastering one. Y axis a relative value to define ranking popularity between all other items.
Have fun!

He already has 15 iOS apps to his name and dreams of designing for Apple. At age 12, Santiago became a full-time college student and is on track to earn his bachelor's degree in computer science and electrical engineering by age 16.  By 17, when most teenagers are excited to just have their driver's license, Santiago will have his masters degree. 

A self-professed computer nerd, Santiago is fluent in a dozen different programming languages and thousands of people have downloaded his apps for the Mac, iPhone and iPad.

Learn how Santiago's parents overcame a rigid school system that left their son intellectually stifled and depressed and instead followed an unconventional pathway to nurture his incredible gifts. Santiago's story is truly inspiring and his family's experience provides a powerful model for parents of exceptionally gifted children.

We had an interesting discussion here on Javascript vs Python as a first language.  While both are decent, I'd probably lean towards learning Javascript first and to then move into Python/PHP (backend) second, then perhaps into mobile like Kotlin/Swift (with memory management & design) if so motivated.  For a beginner, having that immediate visual feedback is necessary to keep motivated.  My primary concern with Python is that it even though it is a more ""solid"" language it is also command-line only, and that's just plain boring for most people who have no idea why they'd even want to create a command-line program, much less what a command-line is.  What do you think?

How did our industry start, what paths did it take to get to where we are, and where is it going. What big problems did programmers encounter in the past? How were they solved? And how do those solutions impact our future? What mistakes have we made as a profession; and how are we going to correct them. In this talk, Uncle Bob describes the history of software, from it‚Äôs beginnings in 1948 up through the current day; and then beyond. By looking at our past trajectory, we try to plot out where our profession is headed, and what challenges we‚Äôll face along the way.

She wants to create a more diverse and colourful world of technology, starting with the poetry of code.

Linda Liukas is a programmer, storyteller and illustrator. Her children's book, Hello Ruby, raised a total of $380,000 on Kickstarter. She founded Rails Girls, which has organized workshops in over 230 cities, teaching the basics of programming to more than 10,000 women. Linda worked at Codeacademy, which she left to write stories that teach children about software and programming. She won the 2013 Ruby Hero prize and was named the Digital Champion of Finland by the EU Commissioner for Digital Agenda.

What big problems did programmers encounter in the past? How were they solved? And how do those solutions impact our future? What mistakes have we made as a profession; and how are we going to correct them. In this talk, Uncle Bob describes the history of software, from it‚Äôs beginnings in 1948 up through the current day; and then beyond. By looking at our past trajectory, we try to plot out where our profession is headed, and what challenges we‚Äôll face along the way.

Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) has been a programmer since 1970.

This video is designed to be a guide.  Please note that other complications may exist that aren't addressed in this guide.  While we always strive to provide accurate and detailed information, we can't guarantee that it will fix your TVs issues.  
ShopJimmy is not responsible for any harm that you may cause to yourself or damage to your TV, during the repair process.  
Try all repairs and troubleshooting at your own risk.  Be sure to take all of the proper safety precautions.
In this video we will show how to use the minipro TL866CS eeprom programmer.  
Here we have the box for the eeprom programmer and all of its contents along with two adapters.  
In the box, you will receive a mini cd, with programming software, a USB cable to connect the programmer to your computer, nine blank eeproms, the programmer, and two adapters.
This is how to connect the USB cable to the programmer.
The other end here, connect to the USB port on your computer.
Start by flipping up the lever, then place your adapter into the slots, on the top of the programmer.
Be sure to align pin 1 as shown in the diagram on the programmer.
Once the adapter is in place push the lever down to securely lock it.  
Push down on the top of the adapter to open the pin terminals.
Correctly align pin one on the eeprom according to the diagram on the programmer.  Once the eeprom is aligned, use the tweezers to push down on the top of the eeprom to hold it in place, and then release the top of the adapter to create the best connection.  
Open the programming software.
Choose the device to program to.
Load the file to be programmed.
Click on the programming button.
Click Program.
Programming should begin immediately.  
If you receive this error, go back and reseat the eeprom in the adapter and then try again.  If you receive the error 5 times, it means there could be something wrong with the actual eeprom, and you should try a different eeprom.  
The yellow light on the programmer, will light up when programming.  
Programming time can vary depending on the file size.
You may also receive an error halfway through the programming.  At that point, that means there is something wrong with the chip and you should try a different eeprom.
Next, we will show how to read data from the eeprom, and save it to burn to a new chip.
If the chip is damaged or corrupt, you will not be able to read the original data.  
Select the device you are reading from.
Click the Read from Chip button.
Click Read.
After the read is successful, click Cancel.
Click Save.
Choose a location to save the data.
Click OK, after a successful save.

#1 will SHOCK YOU!

A lot of people ask me about what programming languages they should learn. I found myself in a difficult situation because this is a very hard question to answer. There are a lot of things that need to be taken into account before making a decision, especially when it comes to which programming language you should learn.

Last year's video was very popular. A lot of people found it useful and they got pretty much value from it. Those who followed my advice definitely took benefit from it, being able to boost their careers in 2020 by learning those programming languages.

One of the easiest ways to decide which programming language to learn for 2020 is by listening to the market. #programming #programminglanguage #coding

The market will definitely tell you what will be the trending programming languages for the future. We must be aware of the trends and watching the news and the rise of new technology so we can adjust the sails on which programming languages to learn, especially in 2020 with a lot of new things coming up.

This video was not based solely on my opinion. I researched a lot and I came up with these 8 programming languages to learn in 2020.

Hi, I'm John Fish, and I'm a Harvard Computer Science student. In this video, I talk about all of the various projects which I have completed in my ten year journey of coding. I started out learning basic HTML and CSS and making HTML tutorials and CSS tutorials. I then began learning Javascript and creating webpages with Javascript. Then, I began to learn Python and started contest programming. I then continued with Python, web programming, and picked up some other languages along the way. In this video I talk about my national-medal science fair project, Harvard Computer Science curriculum, Harvard Computer Science classes, Harvard Computer science projects, and so on. In this video I give examples of artificial intelligence programs which I have written and I explain basic artificial intelligence for games.

ReVeUvwTGdU,coding,youtube#video,2018-07-24T17:00:13.000Z,UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA,3 years of Computer Science in 8 minutes,"This is the most asked question on my channel by far so I thought I'd explain how I learned programming. In the process I got a little distracted and accidentally explained all of computer science in 8 minutes (kind of). 

The goal of this video was to show you the connections between modern day (high-level) programming and how it was implemented at the low level. I show you the basics in Java and convert it to C code, then into Assembly, which leads me to talk about how computers perform addition/subtraction, and the logic design behind that is all implemented with transistors. In case you couldn't tell, I love low level programming. Just a disclaimer that I'm not saying this is the best way to learn programming I am simply sharing what I feel was the most valuable in my learning so far. I know many people start with web technologies which can be a great introduction as well! I am currently teaching myself a lot of server networking & all that stuff. I just believe if you really want to understand how to design algorithms and solve problems in creative ways then the most valuable things you can learn are at the low level. Even though C is 40 years old it is still regarded as producing the most efficient code since you have full control over pointers and memory management with minimal overhead. (the only thing faster is assembly.. an even lower level)

Programmer Boris is here! I had to get some floppy disks and a new drive to finish this video so it took 3 whole weeks to finish. But final product is better than ever!
In this video I am teaching to code in a very easy programming language - Python. Python is great for beginners and written in a very logical way. Once you learn the structure of this language, it can be applied to other coding languages as well.
This tutorial shows how to use ""if"", ""else"", ""while"" and some basic functions.

Are you looking to hack into the mainframe, bypassing the system security lock to gain root access into the private kernel?  Well, if I can do it, so can you!

* ABOUT SITTING:  It is highly unhealthy to sit for long periods of time.  I always get up and take a short break every 30 minutes.  Note though that even with breaks, it is known that long periods of general inactivity will put your body to sleep and you need to take longer walks/jogs throughout the day to keep up a healthy metabolism. Take care of your back/neck posture as well.

Kamu ingin memesan makan malam, kamu tinggal klik saja dan makanannya tiba. Kamu ingin mengetahui jadwal bioskop, kamu mengetik, mengkliknya dan tanpa disadari, kamu sedang duduk di bioskop bersama teman-temanmu menonton film terbaru. Jika kamu berhenti sejenak dan memikirkannya, bagaimana cara kerjanya? Nah, jawabannya adalah coding. Tapi, apakah bisa coding melakukan itu? Dan apakah kamu pernah berpikir bahwa coding sangat menakjubkan sehingga bisa mengubah hidup kita?

Banyak dari kita berpikir bahwa coding adalah sesuatu yang hanya bisa dilakukan oleh orang-orang yang sangat cerdas. Banyak orang berpikir bahwa kita membutuhkan gelar serjana di Jurusan Ilmu Komputer. Namun, di video ini, Muhammad Salis (Android Developer di GO-JEK) akan menjelaskan bahwa coding itu lebih mudah daripada tampaknya.

Sebagai self-taught programmer yang mempelajari coding sejak 2 tahun yang lalu, Salis mengatakan bahwa coding selalu dibutuhkan dalam kehidupan kita - dimana saja dan kapan saja - terutama di perusahaan start-up seperti GO-JEK. Namun, apa itu coding? Coding adalah instruksi spesifik yang diberikan oleh programmer, untuk memberitahu kepada komputer apa yang harus dilakukan. Dengan demikian, belajar coding itu setara dengan belajar bagaimana memberi instruksi yang jelas dan ringkas menggunakan bahasa yang spesifik. Di video ini, Salis tidak hanya menunjukkan tutorial dasar coding yang mudah dimengerti, tetapi dia juga akan mendiskusikan bagaimana coding digunakan di GO-JEK.

Nah, apakah aspek-aspek penting yang harus kamu pahami saat kamu mengerjakan coding? Nonton aja disini!

...............

The year is 2017, everything can be done in one click on your phone or computer. You want to order dinner, you just click it and the food arrives. You want to know the cinema schedule, you type in, you click it and next thing you know, you‚Äôre sitting in the theater with friends, watching the latest film. If you stop for a moment and think about it, how does it work? Well, the answer is coding. But, can coding really do that? And do you ever think that coding is so amazing that it can change our lives? 

Many of us think that coding is something that only very smart people can do. Many people think that we would need a college degree in Computer Science. However, Muhammad Salis (Android Developer at GO-JEK) will explain that coding is simpler than it seems to be.

As a self-taught programmer who first learned to code just 2 years ago, Salis argues that coding is always needed in our lives - everywhere and anytime - especially in a tech start-up company like GO-JEK. Yet, what is coding? Coding is the specific instructions given by the programmer, which tells a computer what to do. As such, learning to code is equivalent to learning how to give clear and concise instruction using a specific type of language. In this video, Salis will not only show you a basic tutorial on coding that easily understandable, but he will also discuss how coding is used in GO-JEK.

Well, what are the important aspects should you understand when you are working on a code? Watch it here!

üíõ FUN FUN FUNCTION
Since 2015, Fun Fun Function (FFF) is one of the longest running weekly YouTube shows on programming üèÖ thanks to its consistency and quality reaching 200,000+ developers.

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Failing Together concept is what makes FFF unique. Most coding content out there focus on step-by-step tutorials. We think tutorials are too far removed from what everyday development is like. Instead, FFF has created a completely new learning environment where we grow from failure, by solving problems while intensively interacting with a live audience. 

Tutorials try to solve a problem. Failing Together makes you grow as a developer and coworker.

üìπ Each show is recorded live on Twitch in a 2-hour livestream on Mondays. The host, assisted by the audience, is tasked to complete a programming challenge by an expert guest. Like in the real world, we often fail, and learn from it. This, of course, reflects what the audience identifies with, and is one of the most praised aspects of the show. 

‚èØ On Fridays, an edited version of the show is adapted for and published on YouTube. 

Content Topics revolve around: JavaScript, Functional Programming, Software Architecture, Quality Processes, Developer Career and Health, Team Collaboration, Software Development, Project Management",Fun Fun Function

With his wit, intellect, and didactic aphorisms, Asitang truly paints a picture on what it means to be the modern day data science superhero. Facing some of the world's most complex engineering challenges in the space science frontier, Asitang sheds incredible light on how combining open source technology with multi-disciplinary collaboration at NASA, paves the way for some of humanity's most ingenious solutions. He pokes fun at and tries to explain the various quirks of this new, fast growing and at times vague field of data science and engineering in simple and easy to digest terms. As a data scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Asitang is paving the path to some of the space world's most complex challenges with wit, innovation, charm, and true intellect. In his free time, he loves talking technology and how its truly helping put us one step closer to exploring the unknown frontier: Space This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Check out the ultimate guide: http://bit.ly/2P1FEJl or watch this video to learn what you need. Data science is a super-hot topic and it is the most promising job of 2019. But what do you need to become a data scientist in 2019?

Along with this question, you probably want to find out whether your skills are appropriate for this field, what steps you need to take to become a successful data scientist, and if your background will affect the chances of becoming a data scientist. All valid questions!

So, to help you answer your questions, we examined 1,001 linked LinkedIn resumes of people who are currently working as data scientists to see where exactly they come from and what skills they‚Äôre using in their day-to-day activities.
 
The main messages we extracted from our study both last and this year, is that if you have the skill base that makes a data scientist, you can be a data scientist. It will be interesting to see how the data science profession changes in the next 2-5 years, but right now, a universal data scientist profile appears to be taking shape: a unique programming language toolbox desired across industries and locations; preferably a Master‚Äôs degree, or a Bachelor‚Äôs and proof of practical abilities; and a confident learning-on-the-go attitude are the currencies of the field.

This is a video of one day of my life at upGrad as a Senior Data Scientist.

If you like this video, please subscribe üîîto our channel for more such videos on Data, Digital and Technology.

Data Scientists are expert professionals equipped with a combination of coding, mathematical, statistical, analytical, and ML skills. They explore and examine large datasets gathered from multiple sources, clean it, organize it, and process it to facilitate the ease of interpretation. While they can do analyzing tasks of an analyst, they also have to work with advanced ML algorithms, predictive models, programming and statistical tools to make sense of data and develop new processes for data modelling.
#DataScientists can also be labelled as a Data Researcher or a Data Developer, depending upon the skill set and job demand.

If you too aspire to become a #DataScientist, check out upGrad & IIIT Bangalore PG Diploma in #DataScience: http://bit.ly/2OyAh13

Does that mean it's better to become a data scientist than a web developer? Become a data scientist today: https://engineeredtruth.com/DataCamp

Though data scientists do get paid more, they require a much higher level of education and most have a master's degree (88%). It's a lot easier to get a web developer job especially if you're looking for remote positions or to work for a smaller company.

Also, web development is more tangible making it an easier subject to learn.

There are some very dangerous animals on earth, but domesticated dogs are not. it‚Äôs unfair to callously label a dog as dangerous. 
Nevertheless, it can‚Äôt be helped that some dog breeds have more potential to cause serious harm if the dog were to decide to attack.
Lastly, It is important to note however that most dogs are bred with the desire to please their masters. 
Thus most incidents involving dogs stem from improper training and harsh ownership.
Therefore, we have listed 10 most dangerous dog breeds focus on the potential of a dog to cause serious injury. We hope you enjoyed it üôè

If you're a dog owner, you surely want your pet to be healthy and to live a long and happy life. But you might sometimes do things that can potentially harm your canine companion without even realizing it. Here are some common mistakes people unintentionally make when it comes to taking care of their doggies. 

TIMESTAMPS
Choosing the wrong collar 1:00
Leaving a dog alone in the car 3:08
Neglecting your dog's teeth 4:15
Letting your dog eat everything 6:07
Bringing puppies to a dog park 7:47
Using physical punishment 8:13
Providing too little stimulation 9:48
Not securing your dog in the car 10:31
Yelling when your dog does something wrong 11:05
Skipping flea, tick, and worming treatment 11:28
Leaving harmful objects around 11:51
Neglecting breed-specific health issues 12:22

SUMMARY
-There are several types of collars, and you need pick the one that best suits the needs and character of your pup, as well as a place to attach his license. Whether you've settled on a harness or gone for a collar, the second (and just as important!) step is making sure it‚Äôs the right size. If a collar or harness is too big, your pooch may escape.
-Dogs don't sweat like people do, so they can overheat much faster than you‚Äôd think. And since they lack this crucial ability to cool themselves off, the consequences of staying in a locked car can turn out fatal.
-A dog‚Äôs teeth need to be cleaned just like people‚Äôs teeth do. Don't use toothpastes and toothbrushes designed for people! There are special ones made just for dogs, and they‚Äôre pretty different from the human kinds.
-Never feed human food to your dog! It's way too salty, too spicy, and too fatty for them. In fact, most dishes you eat are severely toxic for them.
-To start with, dogs can sometimes be passive carriers of diseases. Secondly, grown-up dogs, especially large ones, can be incredibly rough when playing and running around.
-Physical punishment doesn‚Äôt work and actually does the opposite of what you want ‚Äì it makes your dog scared of you. Reward-based training is much more effective than physical discipline.
-Just like you, dogs need constant mental and physical stimulation-, especially working breeds, which is why regular walking is a must.
-If you don‚Äôt secure your dog in the car and you end up in an accident, your pet can get seriously injured or even killed.
-Dogs don‚Äôt understand ‚ÄúNO‚Äù, so it only freaks your dog out, especially if you‚Äôre ticked off about something that happened a while ago.
-Some people say you can take a break from flea, tick, and heartworm medicine in winter if you live in a cold climate, but you really should discuss it with your veterinarian.
-Dog-proof your house by putting away anything your pet can chew or swallow. Things like medications, screws and nails, magnets, coins, and batteries should never be within your pet‚Äôs reach.
-Always do your research before you get a pet so that you‚Äôll know how to best take care of it and what problems to look out for.

             Hello everyone! Today we rescued a very ferocious dog stuck under a huge pile of stones. See this, the dog sees the stranger as very aggressive. We were walking on the street and heard the loud puppy talking. I stopped the car and headed for the pile of stones looking for a cry. But I didn't hear the cry anymore so I didn't know where the puppy was. I found the dog, it was inserted by large rocks. The dog is so pitiful. But seeing strangers the dog is very aggressive.

¬†¬†        ¬†¬† We have a hard time approaching the dog. I think there is a need to get some food to get used to the dog. While my friend went to buy some food, I tried to get to know the dog. But it seems that the dog is frightened so it is difficult to contact strangers. Fortunately, I touched the dog. See this, the dog loves to ride a motorbike. I'm bringing the dog home. I gave the dog milk, it was so big that I could eat it this way. Currently the dog is much healthier and gradually gets acquainted with everyone in my family. Thank you for watching this video! If you like, raise your thumb to encourage us and the pitiful dogs! Goodbye everyone!

Dogs also have impeccable senses which are not easily matched by other animals or any technology.

but they are also frequently called upon to serve alongside firefighters, military men & women, as well as police officers.

Southern China has always had a tradition of dining on dogs‚Äîpeople from other parts of the country even joke that Southerners will eat anything with legs but the dinner table. But despite becoming more prosperous in the 1990s, Yulin has maintained the unique tradition of holding a canine banquet every summer.

Animal rights activists across China and the rest of the globe have increasingly condemned the Dog Meat Festival, calling for an immediate stop to eating man‚Äôs best friend. They say the dog meat trade is illegal, unregulated, and cruel. Many claim that numerous dogs that end up in cooking pots are stolen pets or diseased strays.

In 2013, the Yulin festival gathered so much negative press that this year, the local government denied the Summer Solstice dog-eating tradition ever even existed. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped locals from celebrating‚Äînor has it stopped die-hard activists from flooding the town to try to rescue dogs before the slaughter.

VICE Reports headed to Yulin this year to get to the bottom of the most controversial festival in China.

Consequently, it‚Äôs unfair to callously label a dog as dangerous. Nevertheless, it can‚Äôt be helped that some dog breeds have more potential to cause serious harm to a person if the dog were to decide to attack. Therefore, our 25 most dangerous dog breeds focuses on the potential of a dog to cause serious injury to a victim.",Romania469

5aAt-Ve0o7U,dogs,youtube#video,2019-06-02T14:00:00.000Z,UCXZpQgX1897wYDLtvzmgyIA,Here&#39;s Why Dogs Jump on You When You Get Home (Plus 49 Other Meanings Behind What They Do),"Since dogs can't talk, it is tough to know what they are thinking. It is also difficult to understand why they do the things they do. Fortunately, there are a few experts who are sure that they know what dogs are thinking. Here's why dogs jump on you when you get home 
Side Sleeping
When a dog sleeps on his side, he is telling you that he loves you and trusts you. 
Stomach Sleeping
When your pet sleeps on his belly, he won't be able to get quality sleep. In this position, he won't be able to reach REM sleep. Shy, gentle dogs often sleep like this. 
Back Sleeping
When your dog sleeps on is back, he may be too hot. If his paws are across his chest, he wants to be left alone so he can sleep. 
Staring
If your dog is staring at you, he isn't trying to be creepy. He just wants your affection. 
Staring With His Tongue Out
If your pet is staring with his tongue out, he wants your attention, but he is happy, relaxed, and mellow. 
Intense Eye Contact 
When a dog is staring into your eyes, he wants to see your expressions to understand what you want from him. 
Open Mouth, Relaxed Tail, High Ears
This means that your dog is relaxed and secure in his surroundings. If you want to approach a strange dog, this is when it is the safest. 
Pointed Tail, Ears Forward
This position means that your dog is curious about something. He may hear or smell something interesting.
Loose Floppy Tongue
A loose floppy tongue means that your dog is happy and doesn't have a care in the world. 
#11 Baring Teeth, Ears Back, Snarling
This is a sure sign that your dog is feeling angry and aggressive. Never approach a dog when he is in this position. 
Raising Bark
If your dog starts barking softly, and it increases, he wants to play with you, and he cannot control his excitement. 
Howling
Howling means that your dog can hear a high-pitched sound like a siren. He is either annoyed, or the sound hurts his ears. 
Low Growl
A low growl means that your dog is anxious and scared. 
Crazy Legged Dead Sleeping
If your dog sleeps on his back with his limbs in the air, he feels vulnerable. It also means that he is secure in his surroundings.
Superman
If your pet sleeps on his belly with his limbs out like Superman flying, he finally crashed. Sleeping like this allows him to pop back up quick when he's ready to play. 
Squinting His Eyes
If your pet squints his eyes when he looks at you, he wants your love and attention. 
Waiting For Approval
If your pet is staring at you like he is waiting to do something, he respects you and wants your option. 
The Fox
If your dog's paws are under his body and his tail is around his face, he is cold. 
Back To Back
When two dogs sleep back to back, it means that they trust each other. 
Waving His Paws In the Air
If your dog is sitting or standing with his paws up, he is concentrating. 
Gifts
If your dog brings you a gift like a shoe or a dead animal, he loves you, and he is trying to make you happy. 
Cuddling After a Meal
If your dog cuddles with you after eating, he loves you and feels comfortable with you. 
Licking
When your dog licks your face, he is easing some of his stress and showing you love. 
Hunched Over
If your pet hunches over, he was just abused or attacked and is trying to make himself feel small. 
Getting In Your Bed
When your dog sleeps in your bed when you aren't home, he wants to feel close to you. 
Joining You In Bed
When your pet is in your bed with you and your partner, he wants to be part of the pack. 
Kicking Their Feet After Pooping
If your pet kicks his feet after pooping, he is releasing pheromones that release a territorial scent. He wants other dogs to know that it is his area, and he is the alpha dog. 
Butt Sniffing
When dogs sniff each other's butts, they are saying hello and trying to get to know the other dog. 
Chasing Their Tail
If you have a puppy, he is chasing his tail because he doesn't realize it's his. If your dog is older, he is bored and trying to entertain himself. 
 Post Bath Energy
If your pet has a lot of energy when he gets out of the bath, he hates being wet and wants to dry off. 
Staying Close By
When your pet stays close by, he wants to be part of your pack. 
Trashing the Couch
If your pet ransacks the house or tears apart the couch, he has separation anxiety, and he needs to relive some of his energy. 
Lowered Front, Mouth Open, Wagging Tail
This means that your dog is having a lot of fun and he is thanking you.

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant

Welcome back ScreenRanters! Oh gosh, do we have a treat for you today! We‚Äôve watched the recent Cats film. We‚Äôve read the reviews. We‚Äôve seen the reaction on social media. Let‚Äôs just say...the film hasn‚Äôt gained any fans. It was a hotly anticipated adaptation that didn‚Äôt deliver the goods in the cinema. Cats went from a legendary musical stage play, to a box office flop. Today, we‚Äôre going to take a look at some of the moments that confused, disturbed, and caused the audience to feel a mighty amount of cringe. 
Even though the film had a cast filled with A-List actors, it still didn‚Äôt do well. Dame Judi Dench, Sir Ian McKellen, Idris Elba, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, Rebel Wilson, and many more. Even the star power of Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo couldn‚Äôt help the Jellicle cats. Anywho, what can you expect to see in the video? Well, you‚Äôre going to see why the film‚Äôs use of catnip is a little disturbing. We‚Äôre going to see what impact Universal Pictures had on this film‚Äôs final edit. Let‚Äôs just say that the director, Tom Hooper, had to do a lot of work before its premiere. Roughly 36 hours‚Äô worth! You can also expect entries involving characters like Jennyanydots, Old Deuteronomy, Victoria, and Macavity. Especially when it comes to their clothes, or lack thereof. Also, we‚Äôll take a gander at the infamous cockroaches! We even throw in a Jackson Galaxy reference or two! The Cat Daddy! So, before we depart for the Heaviside Layer, let‚Äôs see what creeped the audience for this feline flick the most!

After the trailer for ‚ÄúCats‚Äù dropped in July, the internet has expressed its general confusion about the new movie. And since the movie was released on December 20th, 2019, it seems like there‚Äôs not a positive review anywhere. Even fans of the classic Broadway musical have said that the movie is more than a little disturbing. The story is about a gang of cats who compete to go the Heaviside Lair, in hopes of being reborn into a new and better life. 

The musical, and its new film version, have some good qualities. The songs are memorable. And there is a star-studded cast. But the levels of CGI and some of the director‚Äôs choices have audiences across the world cringing. Let‚Äôs take a look at ten moments from the movie that will leave you seriously uncomfortable.

tur9KZXP1l0,cats,youtube#video,2020-01-07T12:00:10.000Z,UCP1iRaFlS5EYjJBryFV9JPw,We Now Know What Really Went Wrong With Cats,"Cats might have nine lives but the film adaptation of Cats was basically dead on arrival.

Perhaps it sounds overly dramatic to declare Tom Hooper's Cats a full-fledged cinematic calamity‚Ä¶ but at this point, the facts are rather indisputable. Now, after a few weeks in theaters, the film stands to lose a whopping $100 million for Universal. That's even after its unprecedented theatrical re-release, which found the filmmakers attempting to ""fix"" the terrifying and ever-offputting CGI felines. 

Meanwhile, the studio quietly yanked Cats from its ""For Your Consideration"" page, effectively ending the film's Oscar campaign before it had a chance to really begin.

Don't make us say it: The film is one serious cat-astrophe. 

Between its abysmal box office performance and wildly low Rotten Tomatoes score, it's clear that audiences and critics really didn't care for Cats... and just looking at the trailers, it's not too hard to see why.

So what went wrong with this Broadway-sensation-turned-box-office stinker? Well, in a recent Reddit thread, several VFX technicians who allegedly worked on the film reveal what went down behind the scenes‚Ä¶ and the situation, if true, sounds pretty dire. Apparently, we can place the blame squarely on impossible deadlines, unrealistic demands, and numerous poor decisions made by Hooper.

As we mentioned, Universal pulled a stunning move shortly after the film hit theaters, announcing that Cats had to be re-released in order to address some very obvious CGI blunders. For one, there was the generally unsettling look of the human faces haphazardly pasted onto digital cat bodies... not to mention a major muck-up involving Dame Judi Dench's cat character, Old Deuteronomy.

That particular mistake was publicized by Variety's Jenelle Riley, who wrote on Twitter:

""This isn't a joke: CATS was rushed into theaters before being finished so a new version is being sent to theaters with updated effects. How do you know if you have the old version? Look for Judi Dench's human hand, wedding ring and all.""

Also worth noting: The production schedule was reportedly so rushed, Hooper kept maniacally working on what was meant to be the final cut of the film‚Ä¶ right up to Cats' premiere. On the red carpet, he told Variety, 

""I finished it at 8 a.m. yesterday after 36 hours in a row. I just put the finishing touches on. So, I‚Äôm very happy to be here with it fully finished. The premiere should be the first time people get to see it, and this is genuinely a premiere.""

Meanwhile, We Got This Covered sums up the Reddit thread by noting that, quote, ""poor requests from the studio and ridiculously short deadlines made quality work near-impossible.""

In fact, someone claiming to have worked on the film's visual effects wrote,

""Blame the director and clients for their lack of realistic requests.""

According to another supposed VFX technician:

""Often cats were missing layers, lights, and cryptos were unusably broken. But you couldn't ask for a rerender unless there was something egregious like a whole cat missing. The show was one uphill battle for every artist and [supervisor] involved, with a client that could only identify what they [didn't] like, and [who wouldn't] offer any clues as to how to get to what they did like. We did what we could."" 

Another Redditor added: 

""The timelines of these productions is the thing that's frustrating. This movie still may have been a flop even if it [had been] done well, but the super short schedule is what killed this movie.""

Well, as you can see for yourself, the end result looks incredibly bizarre. 

Perhaps one of the biggest problems with Cats is that the movie feels rather driftless and purposeless. Adapted into a stage play by Andrew Lloyd Webber from a book of poetry by T.S. Eliot called Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, the musical follows the adventures of a group of London street cats. Each of them yearns to ascend to the so-called ""Heaviside Layer"" in order to be reborn. At the end of the day, it turns out that a bunch of singing cats fighting over who gets to die isn't what box-office bonanzas are made of.

Audience members who did wind up watching the film likely left the theater wondering what the hell they'd just seen. We have the answer for that one: They'd just seen one of the biggest box-office bombs in recent memory. Watch the video to learn What Really Went Wrong With Cats!

Yb4EGj4_uS0,cats,youtube#video,2019-12-27T18:00:03.000Z,UCP1iRaFlS5EYjJBryFV9JPw,Why Cats Bombed At The Box Office,"Let's all pay our condolences to Cats as it fades away to the Heaviside Layer. The film adaptation of the famous Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical finally hit theatres on December 20th, 2019, and audiences have been passionately avoiding the film ever since. Here's what went wrong with Cats. 

Well, the box office numbers have rolled in for director Tom Hooper's misguided movie-musical, and let it suffice to say, they aren't exactly the cat's meow. In fact, they're absolutely abysmal. Initial box office estimates predicted that Cats would earn about $15 million on its opening weekend. But when the film opened - against Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, no less - it pulled in a dismal $6.5 million domestically. That is to say, the box office returns were effectively in the litter box.

Such numbers would be acceptable for, say, a limited-release art film. But it's completely unacceptable for a tentpole Christmas release packed with triple-A talent - particularly since the film cost approximately $100 million to make. A poor outcome for Cats was rather expected, but the severity of its opening weekend failure is still rather surprising.

Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is a serious box office bomb we're talking about here‚Ä¶ a major cinematic cat-astrophe. $2.2 million dollars on a wide-release opening day means that basically no one saw this movie. Meanwhile, pretty much everyone on the planet knew the film was happening. Seems like morbid curiosity just wasn't enough to get people into those seats. That lack of curiosity killed Cats.

We can't talk about Cats without talking about that soul-bending teaser trailer, which was released back in July 2019. What a day that was for social media. They say that ""all press is good press,"" but they clearly hadn't seen the Cats teaser trailer before making that statement. Many people reacted with abject horror when they got their first look at the sprightly CGI cats, recoiling in horror at all the chirpy celebrity faces grafted onto furry bodies. Some folks hoped against hope that the film was still very much a work in progress.  Keep watching the video to see why Cats bombed at the box office!

The bizarre story, based on a book of poems by T. S. Eliot, revolves around a tribe of cats called Jellicles, which are competing in a singing competition so they can die and be reborn as a better version of themselves.  A new theatrical interpretation of the classic musical features an A-List cast, including Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, James Corden, Ian McKellen, Idris Elba and Taylor Swift. We break down the plot and the characters to help explain why these cats are singing and dancing in the first place, and what it all means.

About:
Based on T. S. Eliot‚Äôs Old Possum‚Äôs Book of Practical Cats, the show is set amongst a larger- than-life junkyard playground and is alive with our favourite feline characters including Rum Tum Tugger, Mr. Mistoffelees, Macavity, Jennyanydots, Old Deuteronomy, Grizabella and Skimbleshanks.

The Jellicle Cats come out to play on one special night of the year ‚Äì the night of the Jellicle Ball. One by one they tell their stories for the amusement of Old Deuteronomy, their wise and benevolent leader, who must choose one of the Cats to ascend to The Heaviside Layer and be reborn into a whole new Jellicle life.",Cats The Musical

If you like the video, share it, like it and subscribe for more.

My kittens laugh at me when I try to solve maze puzzle, so I decided to build them a giant labyrinth and check their skills.

To make the Labyrinth, all you need is some cardboard and free time. First use your imagination to create the route. Then fold the sheets and make your maze. Similar maze can be made for hamster or a rat. Help your pets develop their spatial coordination.

Thanks for all the positive responses!

- Update -
Alot of questions have been asked concerning their relation to each other, gender and so on. They are not related in any way, both are females, approximately 10 years of age when this footage was taken. Mossy is the one to the left, which makes Stina the one on the right side! They are both still healthy and vigorous.

The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat

If you put me in a house, I would much prefer a flat
If you put me in a flat, then I'd rather have a house
If you set me on a mouse, then I only want a rat
If you set me on a rat, then I'd rather chase a mouse

Little Kitten works on all iPhones and iPad 3 and above, no iPod support

Instagram: https://instagram.com/_sparta_the_cat_?igshid=107gt0ycc4vx8
We got a little kitten  on Christmas 2009 and we named her Sparta because we just loved The Mean Kitty Song about Sparta: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6Eqs...

Sparta was spayed in 2013. 

These wonderful little kittens, all got adopted into wonderful homes.

Sparta lives in London (UK) and the people that were talking in the background was in Lithuanian.

Thank you for welcoming and supportive comments :


I couldn't stop crying because they were so adorable

I've never seen a cat giving birth to kittens. It was a wonderful experience, I hope to see it for real, one day.

 laughed so hard at 3:34 lol I thought the cat was a dog for a second

My heart is in pieces, it has never exploded this many times in a row before.

6:07 BEST. CAT SMILING. EVER.

I've never seen or heard a cat pant before

This is probably the most precious video I have ever seen.. Thank you for posting! :)

I have to say I don't like watching anything being born but this video was very nice to see.


It's so wonderful to see you guys are respectfully whispering while she's giving a birth. Such a great footage to capture the beautiful moment. Thanks for sharing :)

Nothing will ever be as cute as this video. NOTHING.

Im a fan of Sparta

after watching this, i am now a cat person over dog. cutest thing i've seen all my life, no exaggeration. during this video was probably one of the only times i've ever said ""awww"" all my life.

This is one of the most touching videos on cats that I have watched. Usually I watch them clowning around or just looking cute. But this one took my heart away. Sparta is so pretty. Her eyes tell the whole story. She is so pure, so innocent, yet she knows just what to do throughout the whole process.

My kittens laugh at me when I try to solve maze puzzle, so I decided to build them a giant labyrinth and check their skills.

To make the Labyrinth, all you need is some cardboard and free time. First use your imagination to create the route. Then fold the sheets and make your maze. Similar maze can be made for hamster or a rat. Help your pets develop their spatial coordination.

Our crazy active kittens finally drove their patient mother crazy as well!
The kittens got bigger and now they have more energy than ever! Non-stop running, jumping, playing, fighting... And occasional backflips, crab walks and arched backs! All in a very funny way!

This cat family is the same family from the ""I followed this limping mother cat and found her whole family in the bushes"" video. If you haven't seen that video yet, check it out:

About Our Channel:
This channel is about the daily lives and adventures of my two indoor cats Santi & Indy and our 7 outdoor cats and my dog Walter.
Santi (8) and Indy (1) live with me in my house and Walter (7) lives in my garden.
And we have 7 outdoor cats living in my dad's garden. Their names are; D'Artagnan, The Rolling Cat, The Purring Cat, D'Artagnan's girlfriend, Porthos, Zoom and The Big Head.
Apart from their videos, from time to time I also upload videos of other animals I come across.
So basically, what you'll find here are lots of funny and cute cat videos, an ongoing miniseries about a cat love drama, sometimes rescue stories and always a whole lot of meowing! Enjoy!",walter santi

Spy In The Wild
To discover just how like us animals really are, animatronic spy creatures infiltrate the animal world to explore their complex emotions. Spy Pup makes friends with a wild dog pack to investigate their maternal love and has a dangerous encounter with lions and elephants. Baby Spy Crocs discover the extraordinary devotion of a mother crocodile and take a rollercoaster ride inside her mouth as she carries her babies to water. Spy Egret and Spy Tortoise are nearly trampled by elephants as they film a newborn baby sharing the love of his caring family. Spy Monkey meets a troop of over 120 unruly langurs and finds out how teenage monkeys comically practise babysitting skills. Spy Prairie Dog witnesses the most enthusiastic kissers in the animal world. Spy Chick discovers the extraordinary devotion of hornbills as a mother is imprisoned for the sake of her brood. In Antarctica, Spy Adelie Penguin becomes entangled in the penguins' turbulent love life as they fight to steal pebbles to impress a fussy female. On the savannah, giraffes are filmed for the first time paying homage to an old giraffe that recently passed away. Spy Bush Baby meets some curious chimpanzees, and Spy Tortoise is adopted by a five-year-old and is taken on a wild ride through the jungle canopy before coming down to earth with a bump. In a thought-provoking scene a chimpanzee shows empathy as he finds an abandoned wildcat kitten and adopts it as his pet.

Lyrics of ""DANCE MONKEY"" by TONES AND I

[Verse 1]
They say, ""Oh my god, I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine""
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Chorus]
So they say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done I'll make you do it all again

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Oh my god, I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes""
Just like a monkey, I've been dancin‚Äô my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Chorus]
So they say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Do it all again, do it all again, do it all again)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
(Do it all again, do it all again, do it all again)
Ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Chorus]
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done I‚Äôll make you do it all again
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before

Monkeys have always been regarded as fun, adorable and entertainingly witty creatures. If you spend your time to learn more about monkeys you must understand that monkeys look like human a hundred percent because the way they feed baby and everything as human. We found two kinds of monkeys in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Pigtail and long tail monkeys. Pigtail monkeys look more intelligent than Long-tailed but in this area there are long-tailed monkeys more than pigtail so long-tailed always do not allow pigtail live with them. There are a lot of cute baby monkeys and smart baby monkeys.

Monkey usually get up so early morning and down the tree to the ground to looking for food. It is depending on the weather, if it is not raining they get up at about 5:00 - 6:00 am but when it is raining they stay longer on the tree sometimes do not down the tree. All baby monkeys and adult monkeys are playing so happily when they get up so early morning, they get fresh air.

Monkeys take some rest after lunch, go up the tree and sleep for long time and when they are hungry they come to the ground to find more food. Mommy monkeys breastfeeding all the time when baby monkeys need but they sometimes do not share food while they are eating because allow only give fresh milk.

üé§ Lyrics: Tones and I - Dance Monkey

[Verse 1]
They say, ""Oh my god, I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine""
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Chorus]
So they say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done I'll make you do it all again

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Oh my god, I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes""
Just like a monkey, I've been dancin‚Äô my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

[Chorus]
So they say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Do it all again, do it all again, do it all again)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
(Do it all again, do it all again, do it all again)
Ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Chorus]
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done I‚Äôll make you do it all again
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done I'll make you do it all again
All again

It was a no brainer for us to cover Wake Me Up by Avicii. Not only is it one of the biggest songs of the last decade, but even without that, it's simply üòè an awesome song. One challenge for us was how to convey the energy that Avicii's recording has. We don‚Äôt know about you all, but we always felt like this song had a kind of country, fiddle, grassroots feeling to it, despite all of the DJ/electronic sounds you hear. So we decided to give it even more of a country feel and really play this song in a fiddle style. Maybe it's the slap-bass Nick does, or the fiddle chords Zack plays - or maybe it's just playing the song on our string instruments that gives it the country feel. Either way, this arrangement of ours has hit the hearts of people all over the world, and we couldn't be more grateful. This is our most viewed music video, and for a long time we didn‚Äôt really know why. I don‚Äôt think we still know fully, honestly, but many people have told us that the happiness of the song and the beauty of the location makes this video energetic, happy, and beautiful. We filmed it at Saguaro Lake (Butcher Jones Recreation Site to be exact) in Arizona. We have been going to this lake for fun outings our entire lives. Many fond memories have been gained here, and it was awesome to shoot this life-changing video here! Thanks for all your incredible support.

LYRICS
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

Whilst I kept an open mind from a beginners perspective, I will still not impressed. It might seem like it worked and did the job, but the main issue for me was the dam tuning - in that it WOULD NOT stay in tune at all.
The fact that it was almost impossible for me, a professional teacher and violinist of over 30 years, to tune it, doesn't bode well for you folks out there who are just starting out. I wish you lucküòÇ

IF you can get past the tuning, the sound is ok. It's pretty bad, but it plays.
I would NOT recommend you waste your money on these cheap violins as it might seem like you don't want to waste money buying something you might not like, but if you can't tune them, you end up wasting your time instead, trying to learn on what is essentially a defective violin.
It's a false economy. You are better to save up a little more and buy something that will not hinder you in the early stages of learning.

Now, if you want something proper to learn on, or even upgrade too, that will only help you learn and not hinder you, I can 100% recommend these Fiddlerman violins!

This video is a collection of all the videos I recorded since I first started to play the violin. From week 1 until today. 

I didn't think I could get this far in the short amount of time I've played :) I didn't really expect anything when i started. I just wanted to try and see how far i'll get :)
I'm mostly self-taught. I had a teacher last year but only had a total of 8 lessons. Hoping to find a new teacher soon :) I hope you like this video. UPDATE: I got a teacher after 2 years and 5 months. I have one lesson every week.

In this video I am playing 30 songs that are great fun to play on an acoustic guitar. Real classics. 
In my 12 years of teaching I know what kind of songs are well suited for learning purposes or just overall fun to play. 
I'm not claiming these are the 30 best songs ever written. To be honest, some songs aren't my favorite by miles. But as a teacher and (hopefully) an inspiration, I want to have a wide palette of songs for you to enjoy! And for all songs goes; they are awesome to play on an acoustic guitar!",Paul Davids

""Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you
Tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets
And ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh take me back to the start
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling your puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me
Come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start""

Hotel California - Lyrics
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night.
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face.
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face.
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
'Relax' said the night man,
'We are programmed to receive.
You can check out any time you like,
But you can never leave!'

Hi there, this is a cool song today:)
Actually when I was I child it was my the most favourite movie, and that soundtrack just blown my mind then. It was really beautiful music and really impressive story shown in the film.

I like to play this song on a guitar but I have never recorded the video for my channel because there there are a lot of covers of this song on YouTube already... but almost all of them are kinda lullaby to my mind. So one day I thought ""what if I add a bit more expression to this?"" it very inspirited me so in a few days I had this arrangement done. But It took me a few weeks to learn to play it very well, to record and to make this video. And I like it. This is my vision of Titanic theme:) 
What do you think?

Hope you hit a thumb up and leave a few words in the comments!

It also gives us an oxytocin boost, which plays an important role in increasing bonding and trust between people. The Showhawk Duo bonded TEDxKlagenfurt‚Äôs audience with their spectacular approach to playing the guitar. Listen to the magic they created on stage with their version of Insomnia - I can't get no sleep, Tiesto‚Äôs Adagio For Strings or the most unexpected thing you can expect on a guitar Bohemian Rhapsody. Young British guitarists Mikhail Asanovic and Jake Wright, together known as The Showhawk Duo, started out as buskers and have since gone on to play all over the globe. They have appeared on BBC Radio 1 on the Nick Grimshaw‚Äôs Breakfast Show, they performed for the LAD Bible and BBC Radio Bristol. They played at the UK's large festivals including the Main Stage at Bestival, Glastonbury, Secret Garden Party, Wilderness, Somersault and more. International performances include F1 Grand Prix in Singapore, Seychelles, club tours in Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands and a 20 - date residency at Pacha in Ibiza.

IMPORTANT: I had too write this because I feel like 7000 hours is a pretty bold statement. This is not 7000 hours of PURE practice. It‚Äôs making tablature (with help of the guitar) arranging songs, figuring out new melodys and a lot more. You kind of get the idea. My approach had never been blood sweat and tears. I‚Äôve always practiced in a way that makes long days with the guitar possible. Right now I‚Äôm working part time with youtube. That means i‚Äôm working part time with guitar. If we talk intense practice, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre low on time. I think 2 hours is huuge for your progress. If you manage to fit that in you will be an amazing player in a couple of years.

Classical guitars are our passion! We are specialized in the highest quality concert guitars as well as historic guitars from around the world. Our passion for these unique instruments and the joy to give guitarists, passionate players, and collectors the possibility to purchase their own appropriate instrument is the motivation that drives us. Another focus is to work closely with established and young, largely unknown luthiers. Together we want to develop new ideas and share experiences with our customers. 

We also recorded pieces for many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, Astor Piazzolla and Isaac Albeniz (Asturias). You will also find almost all the classical music composers that wrote for the classical guitar. Make sure to discover Agustin Barrios Mangor√©, Manuel Maria Ponce, Heitor Villa-Lobos and many more if you don't know their compositions already

Jim Redgate is a highly sought-after Australian luthier, known for his guitars built for artists such as Ana Vidovic, Pepe Rom√©ro and Odair Assad. This lattice-braced model is an exact copy of the guitar that Ana Vidovic plays. Jim Redgate‚Äôs instruments have their own sound and touch. The breath-taking volume combined with rich harmonics and impressive clarity of sound are quite unique. The playability is fantastic, and the guitars are relatively light in weight compared to the Australian standard.
We‚Äôve of course heard Ana Vidovic in concert many times playing on a Redgate guitar, but this guitar convinced us even more of the quality of Jim‚Äôs work. The honesty and spontaneity of each note, the magnificent volume, the ease of playing, and the unique sound character of this guitar make it an instrument not only rare in Europe, but above all extremely enchanting.

I‚Äôm so excited to share this Lego epoxy guitar build.  I had no idea how the Legos would hold together with the epoxy resin, but in the end, I think the guitar came out pretty sharp looking.  

The most challenging part of this guitar build was creating a solid guitar blank from the Legos and epoxy.  I put the Lego pattern on a backplate, and put the Legos face down into a partially cured layer of epoxy, then poured more epoxy to halfway cover the Legos.  After this epoxy cured, I could remove the backplate that was holding the Legos together, pour more epoxy resin over them to fill in the backs of the Legos.  While the epoxy was still fluid, I added a second layer of Legos, and finally came back to fill in the entire form with resin.  After I had the epoxy Lego guitar blank, I could just use standard woodworking processes for guitar building, to shape the guitar from the epoxy Lego blank.

I also added some custom Lego touches with a truss rod cover made from Lego base plate, and replacing the knobs on the guitar tuners with Legos.

Participation was fairly poor compared with previous editions but riders were all bold enough to put a great show. As usual, officially no one made it to the top of the hill but we saw a Suzuki rider managed to pass the finish line with his front wheel. This event is continuing to be a dirt bike graveyard and we love it, enjoy the video!

Me and Lewi Pilgrim show you how to do a range of different skills and tricks which will increase the fun you have on your bike! 

There are so many skills videos out there but me and Lewi thought we'd add to that with these 10 skills and tricks because when it comes to mountain biking you can never stop learning and the more you know the better you'll be! We start things off with a wheelie and then move on to more technical maneuvers all explained as best as possible! All of these skills are aimed at intermediate mountain bikers and if you learn them you will be super stoked at life! Lewi was on the Haibike electric bike and I was on my Haibike enduro bike just to show you that these skills can be used on any bike! 

I hope you enjoy the video!

The race was a two-day event in the heart of a geographical beauty. This is a championship which is held since 1984 and you really see how serious the competitors are. The target is to cover a 230m hill which has a soft right curve and jumpy sections.

Day 1 was mostly a show-off and race day for stock dirt bikes, day 2 was the real deal. 56 competitors were ready with their modified bikes. Each competitor had 4 chances and whoever covers the most gets the trophy.

No one made it to the top at the end. The winner of the race was Vincent Mougenot who covered 222,15 meters at his 3rd try.

Although it was a failure, we found out that fat bikes float really well. Either way, the bike got exposed to a ton of corrosive saltwater. This was kind of the whole point.

When I got home I submerged the Dolomite in fresh water, and then blasted it with a hose for a good while. I could have taken the bearings apart, or attempted to clean out the cable housings, but I wanted to leave it for a few days to see what would happen. 

Although some rust spots appeared the next day, they were easy to get rid of with just a cleaning. I rode this bike a few times this week and I think operating all the stuff on it regularly was beneficial. In fact, the shifter totally seized the day after the ocean. After freeing it up and using it, the bike was shifting as normal. Of course, normal means mediocre.

Based on this, we might get the illusion that the Dolomite is reliable and resilient, but that‚Äôs not necessarily the case. If you take a bike in the ocean, and it performs the same after you take it out, then how refined could it have possibly been in the first place. I think about these things.

Through breaking the bike down and cleaning everything thoroughly, I found that there was a lot more rust on the inside. Still I was able to stop the rust and prevent it from getting worse. Thanks to the grease in the headset and bottom bracket, the bearings and races were actually not bad. Still, I‚Äôve definitely reduced the life expectancy of this bike.

Some people have asked me whether it would be cost effective to upgrade this bike, since it seems impressive for $200. Could it be made into a nice fat bike for a little more? Well, maybe, but almost any way you slice it a better fat bike would give you a lot more for your money. To make this feel like a decent bike it would need a better freewheel, crankset, and brakes for starters. At that point you‚Äôll definitely want a better chain as well. The shifter is awful too, so figure on that plus new cables. After these changes the bike would feel a lot better, but would still be seriously hampered by the hubs. So although this may be a fun and cheap toy, it‚Äôs debatable whether upgrading it would be cost effective. So this bike is perfect for me as is; cheap and rideable, ready for the ocean.

So that‚Äôs my update on the Dolomite. I‚Äôll leave you guys with some bonus footage from that day.  After the ship passed we took the bike to the other side of the rocks. We had about 4 cameras going. These fisherman started calling towards us. They were trying to tell us that we had company. Within about a second we realized it was only a manatee, a harmless and curious marine mammal. Only in Florida‚Ä¶ Thanks for riding with me today and I‚Äôll see you next time.

I hit stair sets, big gaps and jumps in a quest to find out what this mini MTB is capable of out in the streets! But can it handle it? 

I decided to dust the cobwebs off this mini Haibike mountain bike and take it out onto the streets for the first time in its life. I start things off with the simple stair ride but then things quickly ramp up and become extra exciting with technical BMX style tricks and even huge gaps with the MTB hopper KICKER RAMP! We filmed most of this in chelmsford and although Tom Cardy is injured he was able to join us and show me around some of the cool spots his town has to offer. Unfortunately the rain came at the end so the video gets finished in my hometown on some very familiar riding spots. This tiny 20"" bike is actually a lot more capable than I ever imagined so I feel it will be seeing some more urban MTB freeride action in its life! Do you want to see more of this beast?

I hope you enjoy the video!

FACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/onherbike

BLOG: http://onherbike.com

In April 2017 I left Australia for a solo trip around the world on a BMW F800GS. I named it ‚ÄúAre We There Yet‚Äù, because I don't know my final destination or the duration of this journey.

Poland is my native country. I was born there, grew up there, learnt how to ride motorcycles in my teens there and after finishing university in 2006 - I left there, to emigrate to Australia.

During a long winter, BMW Dobrzanski and Akademia Enduro prepared Chillie for the second leg of my RTW tour. Although I'm from the North East of Poland there were still so many places yet to discover. So for the grand finale I decided to ride the Trans Euro Trail and had a ball!

So long Poland!

If you wish to get more details on my stay in Poland check out my blog post:
http://onherbike.com/content/poland/


Throughout my journey I'm raising money for a young disabled child in Poland named Franek. Franek was diagnosed with cerebral palsy (weakness of the entire right side of the body) and he will require constant rehabilitation for the rest of his life. All the money raised will go directly to helping Franek and his family lead as normal a life as possible so please donate generously: https://gogetfunding.com/arewethereyet/

Lyrics:

Chorus: x2

Baby girl 

What you doing, where's your man? 

I just popped a xan 

Fifty thousand in Japan 

ain't doin no playin 

These red bottoms are no vans 

And she telling all her friends 

I might put them on the gram 


Verse 1: 

Baby girl what you doing 

What's your name? 

I aint playing no games 

See these diamonds in my chain 

Smoking Mary Jane 

Yeah I took her to the brain 

And she fucking for the fame 

So I fuck her in my Range 

Get that money to the top 

Never stop 

mixing red with wock

Used to sell that boy re rock

But i'm the man 

Cuban diamonds dance 

Had to fuck her friend 

I might put it on the gram


Chorus: x2

Baby girl 

What you doing, where's your man? 

I just popped a xan 

Fifty thousand in Japan 

ain't doin no playin 

These red bottoms are no vans 

And she telling all her friends 

I might put them on the gram 



Verse 2: 

Baby wait, hop up in this wraith 

No this not a date 

This a cruise, but don't debate 

It's getting late think its past eight 

Took her to my place 

Baby ate me like some cake 

Call Jake, think I need a eight 

Dopie to the face 

Fuck I need to take a break 

But dont be cool 

Money stupid blue 

Boyfriend is a fool 

I'm trying to make you comfortable",Famous Dex

Thanks to Squarespace, get 10% Off: https://www.squarespace.com/paolofromtokyo  Japan tourists or foreigners coming to Japan may not understand Japanese culture because of this some Japanese dislike foreigners for not understanding Japanese manner and etiquette.  As a generalization, Japanese follow the rules and get frustrated when people don't follow those rules, but often time they generally avoid confrontation when they have these sort of issues.  Based on my experience, this is why Japanese don't like foreigners and tourists and what they are really thinking when foreigners break the rules.  I can't stress enough that these are generalizations and not everyone is like this as everyone is unique, but for the purpose of this video and to show what Japanese may be getting pissed off about, I speak in general terms. These are my Japan tips for tourists to help them understand Japanese manners so they don't make those tourist mistakes in Japan or in that they may be  unknowingly viewed as misbehaving tourists in Japan.  Although some Japanese hate foreigners for doing things in the video, some other Japanese may be okay with the behavior but again I am speaking in general terms.  In general, I don't think foreigners want to be rude tourists in Japan, but because they don't understand Japanese rules or Japanese manner they make the classical foreigner mistakes in Japan.  These are must-know Japan tips to and a Japan guide when visiting Japan.

Japan is, probably one of the most exotic ones. It is known as the Land of the Rising Sun, but it could also be called the Land of singing toilets, the country of the blue traffic light, or the country of vending machines. 

Really, Japan is a unique country, different from the rest of the world. Japanese farmers grow square watermelons, people park and lock their umbrella before going inside a building and there‚Äôs a whole chain of restaurants all over the country where they serve only canned food. In short, there are so many things that make Japan a whole other world. Get ready to explore!

SUMMARY:
- The Yunessun Spa Resort in Hakone offers its guests the pretty unique experience of splashing around in a vat of pork soup and ramen noodles.
-  Specialists make this kind of food from plastic or wax, and it looks just as delicious as the real one.
-  Their photo booths, called purikura, allow you to edit photos right on the spot, adding different backgrounds, funny stickers, or writings. 
- Japan has more than 5 million of them! Mostly because they save time for people who work late hours, which is a pretty common thing there.
- In 2015, Godzilla was granted citizenship in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward. 
- Punctuality is a really big thing there, and train stations do everything possible to avoid a delay.
-  While in many other countries slurping is considered rude, in Japan it‚Äôs a way to show your appreciation of the dish.
- Japanese people don't eat mayo with salads, meat, and sandwiches; in Japan, people usually use it as a topping for ice-cream or on pancakes. 
- World‚Äôs shortest escalator is in the basement of More‚Äôs Department Store, which is located in the city of Kawasaki. The escalator has only 5 steps and is only 33 inches tall. 
- The village of Nagoro used to have a population of 300 people, but less than 40 residents live there now. A local artist, Tsukimi Ayano, made over 300 life-size dolls, most of which look like former residents; and they‚Äôre located in various states of action. 
- It‚Äôs common for Japanese culture to avoid the number 4 because it‚Äôs considered to be very unlucky. 
- They use a blue color instead of green for traffic lights. The reason for that hides in their language: historically, there was only one word for both colors.
- Japanese kids learn how to clean in many schools because it‚Äôs a part of their education. 
- Toilets in Japan are very high-tech. To use one, a person should know what all those buttons are for.
-  Since Japan is a densely-populated country, they don‚Äôt like to waste space. That‚Äôs why their parking lots have a smart system. They‚Äôre designed like multi-level garages.

Imagine a place where one specific fish is part of one of the most ancient cultures of our planet. Here, several generations have worked day in and day out for something special and unique. Here is also the country where people and nature live in harmony. Over a hundred years breeders have developed a unique way to turn a certain fish species into a true work of art.

October, Japan. 

It is harvest season. For most koi breeders this is the moment they have been looking forward to for an entire season.

For several months these fish have been delivered to mother nature high in the mountains.

Despite the daily checks by the breeder, it is not without risk. There is a lot at stake, not just this year's harvest, but also the many years of energy put into the care of these Nishikigoi.

Birds, bears, risk of disease and mother nature, all risks that the breeder must take into account.

Fortunately, breeders such as Tsuyoshi Kawakami have gained generations of experience, allowing them to develop their koi every year full of confidence.

I have been invited to one of the harvests of the Torazo family. In addition to Tsuyoshi Kawakami, his daughter Yuki and her husband Homare are helping to harvest these precious Koi fish.

Life as a rich kid in Japan isn‚Äôt always about being flashy and excessively showing off your wealth. One type of rich kid likes to blend in with the crowd and not put their wealth on display, while the others don‚Äôt think twice about spending six-figures on a luxury automobile. We‚Äôre going to show you both sides of how Japans elite rich kids live. From expensive boarding schools to apartments that cost more than most home mortgages, get ready to take a peek into their lives in our video: Inside The Lives Of The Rich Kids Of Japan.

After they‚Äôre all done with their schooling, some rich kids continue living with their parents, while others move out on their own. It‚Äôs not uncommon for some rich kids to snag a million dollar home, like the five-bedroom mansion we‚Äôll show you in our video. 

An expensive mansion wouldn‚Äôt be complete without a Rolls Royce in the garage, right? Just wait until you hear how much money rich kids are spending on these super expensive cars by adding custom details, such as refrigerators and television sets. When they‚Äôre not driving around in their flashy cars, they‚Äôre traveling by train to see all that Japan has to offer. But this isn‚Äôt your typical train ride. The tickets cost $8,400 for a three-day trip!

From their expensive vacations to dinners that cost $300, the rich kids of Japan are living it up without a care in the world. If you‚Äôd like to learn more about how they live their lives, including the rich girls who spend thousands of dollars at Japan‚Äôs host clubs and the wealthy who bathe in wine, make sure to watch our video. Leave us a comment and let us know which part of their expensive lifestyle shocked you the most!

Follow a Keio University student from morning until evening.  This is a day in the life of University student in Japan attending Keio University, one of the top universities in Japan.  Japan university student life is much different than the Japanese salaryman life as college students have a bit more freedom to pursue hobbies, especially in their senior year of school in Japan.  An average Japanese student in Tokyo may have between 15-23 course hours per week while a Japan University student 4th year Senior will have much less such as 9 hours of course hours per week. Yusuke, 22 year old Policy Management Major at Keio University lives with his parents in a 2 story house which is commuting distance to school via train and bus.  Typical Japanese University life outside of class and study, also allows for part-time jobs and also a social life with friends. In fact, many Japanese students take on part-time jobs and find the time to hang out with friends in groups and join Japanese University Circles.  Generally, a typical Japanese student‚Äôs class semester grade is based on assignments, presentations, group projects and 1 final exam at the end of the semester. But one interesting aspect about the Japanese university grading system is that many teachers don‚Äôt let students know how each category is weighted so students can‚Äôt calculate what they need to score on their final exam to earn a specific mark for the class.  Watch the video and let me know in the comments how this compares to your University Life in your country.

And even such a seemingly ordinary thing as karaoke actually originated in Japan. However, there are still some things that can only be seen in the Land of the Rising Sun.

Really, Japan is a unique country, different from the rest of the world. Wanna have Pringles soup when in Japan? Here you go. In the mood for dinner with a huge plush Moomin in a Japanese cafe? Not a problem at all. Here are some cultural things can‚Äôt be seen anywhere but in Japan.

SUMMARY:
- Most people know that a sure sign they CAN cross the road is the little, lit-up green man, right? Well, not in Japan! There, you should wait for a green rabbit called Miffy.
- In Japan, they grow square watermelons. Nope, it's not a slip of the tongue. In Kagawa prefecture, they produce a couple hundred square watermelons a year.
- When you buy Pringles in Japan, you don't get a tube of potato chips; you get noodles!
- In Japan, if you come to a cafe alone, you get a massive plush Moomin as your lunch companion so that you don't feel sad! 
- A Holiday meal means tons of tasty food and, of course, a big roast turkey! But if you ever celebrate the Holidays while in Japan, don't get surprised to be treated with KFC instead of more traditional food. 
- In the Ginza district of Tokyo, there‚Äôs an unusual stationery store which rises 12 floors! 
- There are more than 50 million vending machines in Japan, and that means they‚Äôre literally everywhere! 
-  If you're in Japan and wondering what souvenirs you can get for your family and friends, try Japan-limited Kit-Kats!
- Suffering from the cold in the winter? Just get yourself one of these one-use pocket-heaters that are so popular in Japan! It's called kairo, and nowadays, you just need to open it for the chemical reaction to begin. 
- Do you love unusual forms of art? Then how about rice paddy art? People plant rice of different colors and types to create breathtaking images in paddy fields. 
- Imagine returning home after a long and crazy day at work. The Japanese have found a solution for this problem - and that's a subway chin rest!

The Japanese justice system and Japanese laws are stricter than many countries and sometimes lead to foreigner arrests in Japan simply because foreigners are unaware of Japan laws and Japan justice system.  The Japanese judicial system has 99% conviction rate in Japan so foreigners should be mindful and aware how strict Japan laws and rules are.  Japanese Police arrests tourist in Japan or Japan Police arrest foreigners in Japan when they are under suspicion of a crime.  Suspects will be brought into police custody to be interrogated for 3 days and if the Japanese police are still not satisfied, the police can request for additional detainment for up to 23 days total, without the suspect being officially charged with a crime in Japan.  In this video, I interview a Japanese Trial Lawyer, Yugo Ishibashi, to help me understand the Japanese justice system as well as to share with foreigners and tourists how Japanese law works in Japan and maybe gain some insight on what options a foreigner has if arrested in Japan.  Japanese police interrogation is quite stressful and Yugo mentions that sometimes suspects plead guilty even though they didn't commit the crime due to the pressure of the Japanese police interrogation.   If suspects don't plead guilty to the crime, it may be possible to be detained for more than a year until the suspect confess to a crime.  This is sometimes referred to as Hostage Justice in Japan.  Convicted persons will end up in Japanese Jail and Japanese prison.  This video should help educate tourist visiting Japan and foreigners living in Japan to help ensure that they are aware of how strict Japanese laws are so that they are careful to not violate the laws when they are in Japan.  But keep in mind that these laws are one of the reasons why Japan is so safe compared to many other countries.  This video is not to deter foreigners or tourists from visiting Japan, but they should just be aware of Japanese laws and the risks when breaking laws in Japan like graffiti in japan or fighting in japan.

The eye of Typhoon Hagibis made landfall shortly before 19:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in Izu Peninsula, southwest of Tokyo.

More than seven million people have been urged to leave their homes amid severe flood and landslide warnings.

Train services have been halted, and more than a thousand flights grounded.

One man was killed in Chiba, east of Tokyo, when high winds flipped his car.

This is the programmer life in Japan.  As a Japanese game programmer you'll see what it is like commuting to work in Tokyo and going to work at one of the largest Video Game Studios in Japan as well as working with other Japanese video game developers, software engineers, video game devs, game designers and even Japanese game directors for a major Japanese Video Game studio.  We follow Masa, a 23 year old, Japanese programmer, throughout his workday and witness what he does during his Japanese working hours as a Japanese game programmer at the Bandai Namco Studios office in Tokyo.  We'll even interact with directors from popular Japanese video game titles such as Tekken and CodeVein.  Plus we'll get to see what a Japanese programmer from one of the large Video Game companies in Japan does after work with friends.  This look inside a Japanese game dev's life is pretty unique and should provide some insight for those people who want to work in Japan as a game developer or game programmer.  Also, this day in the life of a Japanese programmer will show you what it takes to be a Japanese programmer.  As you would expect, most of the work day is spent programming and coding, but there are other unique aspects of the Japanese programmers life we are able to see in this video.

xrgrBJc-64c,japan,youtube#video,2019-11-09T00:00:13.000Z,UCixD9UbKvDxzGNiPC_fgHyA,Average Daily Living Cost in Tokyo Japan,"If you are moving to Japan you might want to know how much does it cost to live in Japan? Or more specifically how much does it cost to live in Tokyo?  This is the expected average daily cost living in Japan  as well as the average monthly cost of living in Japan for someone like me who lives in central Tokyo, at Shibuya station.  Depending on where you live in Tokyo, how far you live from the station, what you eat and what type of products, services and food you consume, a person can obviously reduce overall Japan living costs or go the opposite direction and multiply Tokyo daily living costs.  It really depends on much each person wants to spend on housing, food and activities, but I wanted to provide you with a reference on how much things may cost on an average day in Tokyo for someone like me.  Please take this video as a simple example.  Utilities are based on living in a Shibuya apartment.  Based on the costs, how expensive is Japan to you?  How expensive is Tokyo to you? So if you are moving to Japan definitely might want to consider these daily living costs.

It literally does, and there is a story behind it. 
In this episode, John not only goes inside to see where the elevator takes him, he also drives through it -- in a Lotus Seven. We'll also go up the Umeda Sky Building and catch some fantastic angles of the city, skyline and Gate Tower Building. 

THE STORY: 
Here it is from the building owner. 
It‚Äôs basically a land rights dispute with a sort of happy ending. 
The property was owned by a business (coal and wood company) since the early Meiji era but when business declined, so did the buildings in the 1970s. The area was approved to be redeveloped in 1983 but the property holder refused to give up the land, even though new building permits had been refused to him. The highway corporation and the property owner negotiated for 5 years and what you see today is their compromise. Highways usually buy the land they‚Äôre on but a new law in 1989 allowed the possibility of having two owners on the same spot, really meant for highways to go underground but hey ‚Äì let‚Äôs get creative. 
The highway is the legal tenant of floors 5 through 7. 
The current building tenant on the other floors is TKP. 

WHERE IS THE BUILDING WITH THE HIGHWAY THROUGH IT? 
Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/qGbpaZ1Ktw12
Closest Station: JR Fukushima Station
It's one stop away from JR Osaka Station on the Loop Line. 

Special thank you to TKP and the building owners for allowing me to film inside the building.

Typhoon Hagibis made landfall south of Tokyo on Saturday, moving north and bringing severe flooding.

Thirteen people are missing from the storm, public broadcaster NHK said.

In central Nagano prefecture, water surrounded Japan's famous bullet trains while helicopters plucked stranded residents from rooftops.

A total of 27,000 military troops and other rescue crews have been deployed in relief operations, authorities said.

Childbearing seems to be in the decrease globally in the developed world. While we have niche dating apps on our cell phones to net a potential date and perhaps embark on a relationship, younger generations tend to miss out on the next steps of marriage and having babies. Thus many nations are recording lower birth-rate figures, and nowhere is this more noticeable than in Japan. But is it just the lack of marriages that is responsible for the drop of 1 million people in Japan‚Äôs population statistics? Or are other factors at play?  why is Japan‚Äôs population decreasing?

Ideal finde ich die Sterne in goldenem Papier auch als Christbaumschmuck, wenn man an ihnen einen Anh√§nger befestigt. Auch als Weihnachtsdeko sind sie ideal geeignet und in klein gefaltet sehen sie auch auf dem Adventskranz und in Dekoschalen toll aus. 
Der Stern sieht zwar etwas knifflig aus, ist aber eigentlich ziemlich leicht erlernbar und sp√§testens nach dem zweiten Stern gelingen die nachfolgenden garantiert kinderleicht.

Origami wird ja bekanntlich nicht geschnitten, allerdings wird im Video ein F√ºnfeck geschnitten. Seht es also so, dass mit einem f√ºnfeckigem Papier ein Origami Stern gefaltet wird üòâ

Viel Spa√ü beim Sterne basteln!

No Scissors!,"Dear viewers,  Here's the REAL video for how to make beautiful origami diamonds (or, as Obama chuckled, ""You mean the Chaos Emeralds?"") whose thumbnail has captured the fancy of over 20 million viewers who clicked on it only to discover the actual video was a clickbait sham! --  not even close to the thumbnail. It turns out the thumbnail of the beautiful diamonds was stolen from this paper construction post: http://www.minieco.co.uk/3d-paper-diamonds/  Those beautiful diamonds aren't even origami!  To make matters worse several other copycat click bait videos popped up using the same stolen thumbnail and same deceitful ploy.  Finally Yakomoga made a 23-minute tutorial for how to make the diamond using pure origami here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2_7UyAeqeo which is well done and commendable but his method is extra complex and the bottom point doesn't close well.  So I figured out what I feel is a better way to make it, and the bottom point closes completely without tape or glue.  I even managed to fold it using translucent pearl plastic paper which I featured in the thumbnail and in the outro.  I hope that this video will offer some closure to the viral origami scam that has roped up tens of millions of frustrated viewers and I feel has harmed the reputation of online origami videos.  Let's bring back the Peace of paper!   Sincerely, Jeremy Shafer

If this model is too difficult I recommend trying my easier diamond here: https://youtu.be/I7Qxj17Uohw  It doesn't look as cool but it's about 10 times easier!

The transparent origami diamond was folded from paper that I got from my local Daiso store, but you can buy it online here: https://amzn.to/2I7N20B  .   Happy Puppy Truffles channel has a demo video of the transparent paper here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njxouR-2UWw

- Spell out the color and move the fortune teller in or out for each 
   letter. For example, if the person says ""red,"" move the fortune 
   teller out for ""r,"" in for ""e,"" and out again for ""d."" Pause it in place 
   where it lands.
- Have the person look into the ""mouth"" of the fortune teller and 
   pick one of the four numbers that's visible. Let's say she picks 5. 
   Move the fortune teller in, then out, then in, then out, then in, for a 
   total of five moves. Pause the fortune teller in place where it 
   lands.
- Have the person look into the fortune teller and pick a new 
   number. This time, open the flap and read the fortune that goes 
   with that number.",PPO

On first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.

LYRICS
[Verse 1]
You left my love, you hit the target
You got that rush and then you walk out the door
You kept me small, is what you wanted
I never noticed

[Verse 2]
You held my hand into the darkness
I didn't care it made me just want you more
My god your love it seems so heartless
I never noticed

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hate that you're gone
And I hate that I don't wanna let go
And I hate that you think that I'm weak
Cuz I don't wanna let you know

[Chorus]
That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

[Verse 3]
Each time you left, there was a hunger
I felt so scared, couldn't take anymore
Losing your love, it made me strong
I never noticed

[Pre-Chorus]
And I hate that you're gone
And I hate that I don't wanna let go
And I hate that you think that I'm weak
Cuz I don't wanna let you know

[Chorus]
That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

""Castles""

You left my love, you hit the target
You got that rush and then you walk out the door
You kept me small, is what you wanted
I never noticed

You held my hand into the darkness
I didn't care it made me just want you more
My god your love it seems so heartless
I never noticed

And I hate that you're gone
And I hate that I don't wanna let go
And I hate that you think that I'm weak
Cause I don't wanna let you know

That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

Each time you left, there was a hunger
I felt so scared, couldn't take anymore
Losing your love, it made me strong
I never noticed

And I hate that you're gone
And I hate that I don't wanna let go
And I hate that you think that I'm weak
Cause I don't wanna let you know

That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

That I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

Castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be so much more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

Castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be more than
You ever thought I was
You ever thought I was

I'm gonna build castles
From the rubble of your love
From the rubble of your love
I'm gonna be stronger than

""I just started making music when the original version of ""King Of My Castle"" by Whamdue Project got released. Since then I have considered the record to be a timeless classic that still sounds relevant in 2019. When Keanu sent me his first demo of his K.O.M.C. remake I got excited straight away and tested it out in one of my sets. This immediately sparked a lot of creative ideas in my mind, so I started working on a new version in my studio. We ended up sending a few versions back and forth and then finally, after testing it out more extensively, we agreed on a version that we both loved. Since that day the track has become one of the most requested ID's in my sets and we are excited to finally share it with the world!"" - Don Diablo

Ela √© a governante cruel e tir√¢nica do reino de Tabor e uma bruxa poderosa. Ravenna √© irm√£ de Finn, seu √∫nico aliado, e Freya, a mais nova. Vi√∫va do rei Magnus e madrasta da Princesa Branca de Neve, ela √© considerada a ‚ÄúMais Bela de Todas‚Äù, at√© descobrir que Branca de Neve supera a sua beleza, como tamb√©m imp√µe um risco a sua pr√≥pria vida. Com um feiti√ßo lan√ßado ainda quando era apenas uma menina por sua m√£e feiticeira, Ravenna nunca envelhece, mas para isso precisa sugar a for√ßa vital das jovens de seu reino. Descobrindo que poderia se tornar imortal definitivamente, fica determinada a matar a enteada e consumir seu cora√ß√£o, com isso manteria seu dom√≠nio sobre Tabor e seus poderes para sempre.

Freya, a Rainha de Gelo, √© a principal deuteragonista de ‚ÄòO Ca√ßador e a Rainha de Gelo‚Äô. Ela √© a segunda filha de um feiticeira sem nome, a irm√£ mais nova da rainha Ravenna e Finn, a esposa do duque de Blackwood. Ela se torna uma feiticeira poderosa com a capacidade de manipular gelo e neve, causado pelo assassinato de sua amada filha por sua pr√≥pria irm√£. Depois de sofrer uma trai√ß√£o devastadora, Freya abandonou o reino onde vivia e construiu um novo onde deu in√≠cio a cria√ß√£o de uma legi√£o de ca√ßadores. No entanto, depois de saber sobre a morte de sua irm√£, Freya convoca seus soldados restantes para trazer o espelho m√°gico de volta para ela, mas, inadvertidamente, ressuscita Ravenna das profundezas do ouro do espelho. Agora, Freya deve ajudar Eric, o ca√ßador, e Sara, a Guerreira, sua melhor ca√ßadora, e quem ela baniu por quebrar sua regra fundamental, para lutar contra Ravenna, e impedir que a maldade da irm√£ dure por toda a eternidade.

Sick of All these People Talking, Sick of All this Noise. 
Tired of All these Cameras Flashing, Sick of Being Poised. 
Now My Neck is Open Wide, Begging for a Fist Around it. 
Already Choking on My Pride, so there's No Use Crying About it. 

I'm Headed Straight for the Castle. 
They Wanna Make Me Their Queen. 
And there's an Old Man Sitting on the Throne that's Saying that I Probably shouldN't be So Mean.
I'm Headed Straight for the Castle. 
They've Got the Kingdom Locked Up. 
And there's an Old Man Sitting on the Throne that's Saying I Should Probably Keep My Pretty Mouth Shut. 

Straight for the Castle. 

Oh, All of these Minutes Passing, Sick of Feeling Used. 
If You Wanna Break these Walls Down, You're Gonna Get Bruised. 
Now My Neck is Open Wide, Begging for a Fist Around it. 
Already Choking on My Pride, so there's No Use Crying About it. 

Crying About it...
Cry-cry-crying About it...
Cry-cry-crying About it... about it - 
about it - about it.

#10 Edinburgh [ed-en-bur-ruh] Castle
     One of the oldest castles in Scotland, the castle of Edinburgh [ed-en-bur-ruh] dates back to the Iron Age in the second century A.D. The 385 thousand square foot structure was built upon the plug of an extinct volcano, called Castle Rock, that raises it above the city for which its named. This placement on Castle Rock has given Edinburgh [ed-en-bur-ruh] Castle a spot among Scotland‚Äôs beloved symbols due to its resulting iconic skyline. While it may not be the largest on this list, its history and significance among locals definitely places it as the greatest Scottish castle. 
#9 Citadel of Aleppo [uh-lehp-poh]
     In northern Syria, a 160-foot tall structure towers at the center of the city of Aleppo [uh-lehp-poh]. With a history dating back to the 3rd millennium BC, the massive hill this castle rests on was used by a plethora of cultures: Ayyubids [eye-yoo-bihdz], Byzantines [biz-en-teens], Greeks and Mamluks [maam-lewkz]. Identified as originating from an ancient temple for the ancient Mesopotamian storm deity Hadad [hah-dahd], this structure would develop over the years as a fortress for the armies that would pass through Aleppo [uh-lehp-poh] over the next 5000 years. The hill first became a defensive post under the rule of Greek leader of the Seleucid [see-lew-kihd] Empire and successor to Alexander the Great ‚Äî  Seleucus [see-lew-kuhs]. Establishing an acropolis on this ancient hill in Aleppo [uh-lehp-poh], the Greek control lasted until the Romans took the area in 64 BC. Evidence of the Roman reign is relatively scarce as muslim troops converged on the citadel in 636 AD, and the years following would be spent in conflict between various islamic dynasties. Mongols and central Asian armies would continue to attack the citadel as well and in 1400 AD, the citadel was actually demolished due to combat. It was then rebuilt and renovated multiple times over by the empires and governments that came after. Today the 428,447 square foot citadel is still utilized by rivalling forces in modern strife, and as such has received massive damage in recent years.",Secret Truths

This story takes place in a unknown universe. The universe is full of peace, happiness and positivity. Anyone who are opposite to that are immediately bannished. This may seem like a paradise world but negativity exists for a reason. The universe is unbalanced, in order to have a balanced life you need to feel both positive and negative feelings. Saishu Ruraru is seemingly an ordinary girl, bright, happy and positive. But she is hiding something. She is nominated to become the next Queen due to her 'positive' reputation.  However, her secret makes this an issue. Or is it more of an opportunity? More details in the future part 2! If ya want just like, comment or subscribe!

„ÄäUpdate„Äã

About part 3 of my other glmv's I have to put that on hiatus (cancelled for an uncertain amount of time), my editor was glitching and deleted my entire file of vids that I was working on. Then I got this idea for a new series, then I heard this song and decided to make it a glmv series. Now my prime focus will be some poorly edited memes and this glmv series. Plus I'm going away on holidays for 4 days then the day after I get back I will be heading to my relatives place for another 4 days, then I got this huge event called the 'memorial and then I'm back at school. So I'm a busy girl and also a lazy potatoe, so don't expect alot of vids from me. Man will I be tired after these holidays üò£

High up on an old vineyard Schloss Vitzenburg is located. The castle is surrounded by a landscape you couldn't paint more beautiful. This mansion in the Neo-Renaissance style is visible from far away, so it became the landmark of the region. But the owner of the castle isn‚Äôt interested in rescuing it. Instead it‚Äôs decaying more and more. For decades this place has been closed to the public. But a short time ago we had the chance to enter the castle. We set out on a search for clues, to find out what happened to this historical site which had become famous because of a story about a witch.

Castle was one of ABC's steadiest performers for years, but not anymore. Following a flurry of head-scratching headlines and behind-the-scenes problems, the network abruptly canceled the crime drama after an eight-season run. Where did things go wrong? Well...

-- | LYRICS |--

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I 
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years
And I‚Äôve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I‚Äôve grown 
but I can‚Äôt wait to go home 

I‚Äôm on my way, driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, and it‚Äôs real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends 
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don‚Äôt reckon I did it right
I was younger then, take me back to when we found
Weekend jobs when we got paid and buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we‚Äôve grown
I can‚Äôt wait to go home

I‚Äôm on my way, driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer, And I miss the way you make me feel, it‚Äôs real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast 
One had two kids but lives alone
One‚Äôs brother overdosed
Ones already on his second wife
Ones just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can‚Äôt wait to go home

And I‚Äôm on my way, and I still remember those country lanes
When we did not know the answers, And I miss the way you make me feel, it‚Äôs real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill",Ed Sheeran

Basic and Dynamic Disks
Basic disks have been around since the MS-DOS days and thus have the most compatibility. Dynamic Disks were introduced in Windows 2000 and thus have good compatibility in Windows. Compatibility may become a problem if you use a dynamic disk in Linux. Dynamic disks are supported in Linux however support is dependent on the distribution. Additional packages may need to be installed and the distribution may not support booting from a dynamic disk. Dynamic disks also offer additional features over basic disks. For example, they add a signature to the disk so that if the disk is moved from one computer to another Windows will detect the disk has been moved.

Basic disks cannot be combined with other disks and thus features are limited to one disk. For example, an existing volume can be resized on a basic disk. In order to do this there must be contiguous space free at the end of the volume. If this is not there, the disk will need to be defragmented. Basic disks also support booting where dynamic disks only support booting when configured in certain ways. If you want to combine multiple disks together you require dynamic disks. Windows supports a one way conversion between basic and dynamic disks.

Dynamic Disk Support
Dynamic disks are supported in all Windows Server editions after Windows Server 2000. Client operating systems between XP and 7 require the high business level operating system but after that, all operating systems support dynamic disks.

Combining Multiple Disks
Dynamic disks allow multiple drives or the space from multiple drives to be combined together in order to create one volume. There are a number of different configurations supported.
Spanned volume: A spanned volume combines the space from multiple drives together to form the one volume. This allows you to combine unused space into one volume, however it does not offer redundancy if a drive fails nor does it offer speed improvements. It also does not support booting.
Mirrored Volume: This is when two disks have the same data on them. This allows the operating system to continue running if one disk fails. Unlike other dynamic disk configurations, mirrored volumes support booting of the operating system.
Striped Volume: This volume takes disks of the same size and combines them together to form the one disk. The data is evenly distributed across the disks. It offers excellent read and write performance however does not offer any redundancy. It also does not support booting.
RAID-5: This configuration requires 3 or more drives with the same amount of free space. The drives are combined into one volume. One drive is lost to parity, which is extra data, that means that volume will still keep running if one drive is lost. This volume gives fast read performance but slow write performance. It is available only in Server operating systems and does not support booting the operating system.

Download the PDF handout http://ITFreeTraining.com/handouts/server/virtualhd.pdf

Virtual Hard Disk (VHD)
A virtual hard disk is essentially the data that would normally be stored on a physical drive stored in a file. When a virtual machine is created, virtual devices are created. For example, virtual devices may be created for the CPU, memory and hard disk. The virtual hard disk is connected to the VHD file and thus any data that is written to the virtual hard disk will be written to the virtual hard disk file. Since a virtual hard disk is being used by the virtual machine, this means that the virtual machine can have additional features added that are not possible when using a physical drive. For example, if you wanted to save the state of the virtual hard disk, this could be stored and restored later on. This is referred to in virtual machines as a checkpoint or a snapshot. 

Virtual Hard Disks Explained
When you install an operating system in a virtual machine, the operating system sees virtual hardware. Like physical hardware, the operating system needs device drivers in order to access this virtual hardware. The operating system will communicate with the device driver just like it would to access physical hardware. Once the device driver communicates with the virtual hardware, the virtual solution is able to add additional features. For example, it is able add snapshots and dynamic disks. Dynamic disks is a feature that allows the virtual file to grow in size as data is added to it.

Virtual Hard Disk (VHD)
The virtual hard disk format was first obtained by Microsoft in 2003 when Microsoft purchased the company that developed it. It was used in Microsoft Virtual PC and then was continued to be used in other products like Hyper-V. Virtual hard disks support a number of different formats to store the data in. These includes, fixed, dynamic and differencing.

Fixed
The fixed file format used for virtual hard disks uses a virtual file that is the same size as the physical drive. Since the file is the same size, this offers excellent performance. This is because not much processing is needed in order to determine when the virtual hard disk needs to be accessed. The disadvantage with this is that fixed-size VHD files are slower to create than other virtual hard disk types. This is because in order to create the virtual hard disk file, a file needs to be created that is the same size as the physical hard disk.

Dynamic
Dynamic virtual disks use space only as required. When the dynamic disk is first created, this is a fast process as only the basic data structures are created in the file. As data is added to the dynamic disk, the dynamic disk increases in size. For example, if you store 20 gigabytes of data on a virtual hard disk, the virtual hard disk will be about 20 gigabytes in size. The cost of this is that there is reduced performance of the virtual hard disk. If you add and remove a lot of data, the virtual hard disk becomes fragmented. This reduces the performance of the virtual disk and also increases it size. In order for the virtual hard disk to work as well as it can, the administrator can choose to compact the virtual disk. This rearranges that data on the virtual disk as well as frees up any unused space in the virtual disk and reduces the size of the virtual disk. It is recommended that the virtual hard disk be compacted when the operating system is first installed or if the virtual hard disk is being archived. For example, the virtual hard disk is been saved to removable media like optical media.

The show takes place on the fictional planet of Eternia, a planet of magic, myth and fantasy. Its lead character is Prince Adam, the young son of Eternia's rulers, King Randor and Queen Marlena. Whenever Prince Adam holds the Sword of Power aloft and proclaims ""By the Power of Grayskull!"" he is endowed with ""fabulous secret powers"" and transformed into He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe. Together with his close allies, Battle Cat (who undergoes a similar transformation from being Adam's cowardly pet tiger Cringer), The Sorceress, Teela, Man-At-Arms and Orko, He-Man uses his powers to defend Eternia from the evil forces of Skeletor. Skeletor's main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of Castle Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers. If successful, Skeletor would have enough power to rule Eternia and possibly the entire universe",He Man Official

Part architecture vlog, part behind-the-scenes look at some of the tasks architects work on each day: from designing a set of elevations to managing projects in construction, to writing specifications, to managing an office, and how to deal with the inevitable creative blocks creatives face on a daily basis.

I intentionally structure my day to be divided between making in the morning and managing in the afternoons, with a mid-day transition break for exercise. Learn why this works for me and follow along as I work through some of the most common struggles an architect faces in daily professional practice.

For aspiring architects, architecture students, and those curious about exactly what it is that architects do each day.

In future vlogs I hope to be able to show more of the construction coordination and dialogue that happens outside of the studio as this is where so many decisions are made.

Instead, let‚Äôs take a look at some of the most innovative architectural masterpieces humankind has ever completed.

Subscribe for weekly wacky videos and learn interesting facts about the world with awesome top 10 lists and other amazing videos.

8. Eiffel Tower
When Parisians first saw the Eiffel Tower, many thought it was an eyesore. Now, it‚Äôs become a symbol of the city of light's romantic aura. This wrought-iron lattice tower rises from the grounds of the Champs de Mars (shamp duh mar). You can find the restaurants on the first and second levels. The uppermost platform you can reach is 906 feet or 276 meters above ground. While yes, there is a staircase to the top, most people opt to use the elevator. 

7. Senedd (sen ehthe)
  The Senedd, the National Assembly buildings of Wales, is located in Cardiff. Queen Elizabeth II opened the committee center in 2006. Senedd measures 57,100 square feet or 5,038 square meters in area. It contains a debating chamber and three large meeting rooms. It certainly looks interesting outside, but if this building is known for anything, it‚Äôs what‚Äôs inside. The most well-known area is the public sitting and exhibition area which showcases a glass floor and an undulating ceiling made from Western Redcedar timber. 

6. Hagia Sophia (eye ah sofia)
It was once a Greek Orthodox Christian cathedral which then turned into an Ottoman Imperial mosque. Nowadays, it is a museum. Located in Istanbul, Turkey, the Hagia Sophia attracts 3.3 million visitors every year and was Turkey‚Äôs most visited tourist attraction in 2015. Byzantine Emperor Justinian I ordered the building of the cathedral in 532. Brick makes up the entire structure aside from the four marble pillars outside. 

5. Taj Mahal
Here‚Äôs another favorite world monument with four pillars outside! The Taj Mahal is composed of white marble and is situated in the city of Agra, India. Many people mistake the Taj Mahal for a palace when, in fact, it‚Äôs a mausoleum. Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the project as a resting place for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Inside is not only tombs but also a mosque, guest house, and gardens. UNESCO cited the Taj Mahal as the ‚Äújewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world‚Äôs heritage.‚Äù

4. Leaning Tower of Pisa
No architecture list is complete without the Leaning Tower of Pisa! Everybody loves to come here to take a novelty photograph against this free-standing bell tower because of its four-degree lean. Why does it do that? The foundation on which the Tower of Pisa stands on is unstable. One side has softer ground and cannot support the weight, which causes the tilt. 

3. Lotus Temple
We think you can take a wild guess as to why it‚Äôs called the Lotus Temple. This breathtaking house of worship was is designated for the Bah√°'√≠ (buh hi) faith, a religion that teaches the worth of all religions, meant to establish world unity. The Lotus Temple is in New Delhi, India. It opened in 1986. 


2. Gardens By The Bay
Nothing else looks quite like the alien-like landscape of Singapore‚Äôs Gardens by the Bay. Located next to the Marina Reservoir in the Central Region of Singapore, Gardens by the Bay is a 250-acre or 101-hectare group of gardens that houses the largest glass greenhouse on Earth. This is a photo of Cloud Forest, which replicates the cool and moist conditions of tropical mountain regions in Southeast Asia and South America.

bauhausWORLD  - The Effect (2/3): https://youtu.be/LW1415Ddf8c
bauhausWORLD  - The Utopia (3/3): Online on January 27, 2019 

The three-part documentary bauhausWORLD marks the 100th anniversary of the opening of Germany‚Äôs best-known art, architecture and design school, the Bauhaus. Exploring the legacy of this iconic German institution, our film crew traveled the world, meeting architects, artists, urban planners, doers and dreamers. Do the Bauhaus‚Äôs social ideals and design principles still shape how we live today?

New approaches to education and training, architecture, painting, dance and design were explored and developed at the Bauhaus. Its founder and director Walter Gropius attracted the leading creative figures of the era, including Hannes Meyer, Mies van der Rohe, Lyonel Feininger, Oskar Schlemmer, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, Anni Albers, Josef Albers and Gunta St√∂lzl. Today, Bauhaus is considered the birthplace of Modernism and has become a byword for sleek, functional design.  

Founded in Weimar in 1919, the Bauhaus school moved to Dessau in 1925 and then to Berlin, where it was forced to shut in 1933 after Hitler seized power. Most of its artists, architects and visionaries emigrated, fanning out and spreading the Bauhaus doctrine around the world.

Filmmaker Lydia Ranke and her team traveled the world to make the three-part documentary bauhausWORLD. Alongside the Bauhaus sites of Weimar, Dessau and Berlin, they visited cities such as Tokyo, Amman, Tel Aviv, New York, Chicago, Mexico City and Medell√≠n, talking to experts from architects Norman Foster and Tatiana Bilbao to architecture critic Mark Wigley, furniture designer Yinka Ilori and fashion designer Kasia Kucharska. 

""The Code"" is the first part of bauhausWORLD. The search for the secret of Bauhaus‚Äôs enduring success leads all the way to Japan - a journey illustrating how the forced closure of the school that drove the movement into exile served to spread its philosophy around the world.

k4dVgbuxBAw,architecture,youtube#video,2017-03-22T18:03:45.000Z,UCoc2ZM2cYas4DijNdaEJXUA,Architecture Short Course: How to Develop a Design Concept,"All architecture begins with a concept. If you‚Äôre struggling to find one, curious about what one is, or wondering how architects begin their projects; this short course will walk you through the process I use and some of the techniques I rely on to develop architectural concepts all illustrated with one of my residential projects.

Design is a dialogue, and the concept ensures you have something to talk about. In this video I discuss the precise steps I take when beginning each project and how those steps lead me to an architectural concept.

Before we can develop the concept, we have to first understand the practical constraints. My design process begins only after gathering and assessing all the given parameters for a project. Now, this primarily consists of three types of information. There‚Äôs information derived from the site - things like: local climate, the prevailing winds, the solar aspect, vegetation, neighboring structures, the site‚Äôs history, and any unique liabilities or opportunities. The site of course also comes along with legal frameworks for development, which describe where and what we can and can‚Äôt build.

The second type of information we‚Äôll gather is from the client. Every client has a set of cultural beliefs and preconceptions, preferences and agendas. Of course, we‚Äôll want to determine their budget, and understand the personality traits and organizational politics which might also shape the design. The client and the building type together determine what architects call, ‚Äúthe program‚Äù which is essentially a detailed accounting of all the spaces the building will contain.

And the third type of information I gather is related to the building typology ‚Äì is it a museum, a home‚Ä¶or a school for example? To learn about a building typology we often conduct an analysis of notable or relevant historical precedents. We want to know the essential problems these types of structures grapple with. Understanding the history of the archetype allows us to approach a problem from a fresh perspective. 

All of this is necessary information that we collect for every project. This inventory can also serve as the progenitor for the design concept ‚Äì our seed idea. And, rather than shunting creativity, these constraints often incite the creative process.

Concept Inspirations Discussed:
- Site
- Client
- Narrative
- Materials
- Structural
- Mainifestos
- Formal

As with a good film, the setting, the characters, the cinematography, and the plot all conspire to make it what it is. It‚Äôs the experience you‚Äôll recall rather than the concept per se. Sure, the concept sets the film in motion and it‚Äôs the starting point for all that follows. But this concept ‚Äì the one or two-line description ‚Äì can‚Äôt possible capture the richness and depth of the finished film‚Ä¶or in our case the architecture. Yet without it, the work is unfulfilling and so it should be clear that the concept is necessary for all our work as architects.

Bring the community into the process,"When asked to build housing for 100 families in Chile ten years ago, Alejandro Aravena looked to an unusual inspiration: the wisdom of favelas and slums. Rather than building a large building with small units, he built flexible half-homes that each family could expand on. It was a complex problem, but with a simple solution ‚Äî one that he arrived at by working with the families themselves. With a chalkboard and beautiful images of his designs, Aravena walks us through three projects where clever rethinking led to beautiful design with great benefit.

Building models remains an important tool and part of my architectural design process. And with good reason, there's a feedback loop existing between brain and hand known as embodied cognition. It's been shown that our motor system influences our understanding and cognition in much the same way the mind can influence our physical actions. I build models to unlock creative inspiration I can't otherwise access.

Find the tools + materials seen in the video here:
http://thirtybyforty.com/blog/architectural-model-making-tips

Architects build two fundamentally different kinds of models: presentation models (very finished versions of their design) and study models. Study models are sketchy and useful during the design process when we want to quickly study different ideas. Because they're less rigid versions of real buildings they allow us to explore and iterate quickly. You don‚Äôt need to start with a floor plan or an elevation design, the idea is to collage and 'sketch' using planes and solids in three dimensions.

The building is designed with two simple shapes in mind, the square and the circle. The building is quite simple in concept composed of two main parts. The nucleus of the composition is a long tall functional core called the nave. And the second, and most critical part is the flanking symmetrical structural system. The nave is where the most historically elegant of all shapes is celebrated - the circle. Circular windows, appear in cathedrals across the west. The classical name is the Rose windows. Four rose windows adorn the massive nave. The windows are not only circular but employ the circle throughout the design. The windows are set in massive translucent walls. Like other cathedrals of the world the nave is flanked by columns, however, these are columns of light. The windows are simple in shape. They accentuate the verticality of the space and yet dare not compete with the delicate nature of the rose windows at either end. The forces generated by the tall slender nave create the need for structural buttressing. The flying buttresses, much like those throughout history, are massive soaring forms that repeat along the length of the structure. They serve to brace the central portion of the building as well as house office and worship spaces along and inside the cathedral structure. The building peacefully floats above the ground taking advantage of the gravity free environment that exists in my mind, and if you like, in the minds of those that with imagination. But why or how? No matter. The mind is an infinite playground for the invisible or implausible. However, sometimes thoughts become real. But this, after all, is not. It‚Äôs just a drawing by an architect of an unlikely piece of architecture. I‚Äôm Doug Patt we‚Äôll see you next time.",How to Architect

In this eloquent talk, Michael Murphy shows how he and his team look far beyond the blueprint when they're designing. Considering factors from airflow to light, theirs is a holistic approach that produces community as well as (beautiful) buildings. He takes us on a tour of projects in countries such as Rwanda and Haiti, and reveals a moving, ambitious plan for The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which he hopes will heal hearts in the American South.

Wait until you see some of the architecture fails on today‚Äôs video. Now we‚Äôre not saying these buildings are ugly (not all of them anyways) but the architects might have missed something while trying to design them. Take the leaning tower of Pisa. It was built on soft marshy land which is why today it leans. Then there‚Äôs the secret intelligence service building which is not secretive at all. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget about the Walt Disney Concert Hall which was built with shiny metal plates. The problem with this design is that the plates would catch the sun, magnify its rays, and reflect it to poor bystanders. These are a few examples of some of the architecture fails found on today‚Äôs video. Check out our video to learn about the Ray and Maria Stata Center, W.E.B. Du Bois Library, the Longaberger Company‚Äôs home office, the Grand Lisboa hotel, and others.  Get ready because these are 25 biggest architecture fails you‚Äôll ever see.

Modern architecture or modernist architecture is a term applied to an overarching movement, with its exact definition and scope varying widely.[1] The term is often applied to modernist movements at the turn of the 20th century, with efforts to reconcile the principles underlying architectural design with rapid technological advancement and the modernization of society. It would take the form of numerous movements, schools of design, and architectural styles, some in tension with one another, and often equally defying such classification.[1] The term Modern architecture may be used to differentiate from Classical architecture following Vitruvian ideals, while it is also applied to various contemporary architecture styles such as Postmodern, High-tech or even New Classical, depending on the context. In art history, the revolutionary and neoclassical styles that evolved around 1800 are also called modern.

The concept of modernism is a central theme in the efforts of 20th century modern architecture. Gaining global popularity especially after the Second World War, architectural modernism was adopted by many architects and architectural educators, and continued as a dominant architectural style for institutional and corporate buildings into the 21st century. Modernism eventually generated reactions, most notably Postmodernism which sought to preserve pre-modern elements, while ""Neo-modernism"" has emerged as a reaction to Post-modernism.

Notable architects important to the history and development of the modernist movement include Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn, Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, Gerrit Rietveld, Bruno Taut, Arne Jacobsen, Oscar Niemeyer and Alvar Aalto.

Common themes of modern architecture include:

the notion that ""Form follows function"", a dictum originally expressed by Frank Lloyd Wright's early mentor Louis Sullivan, meaning that the result of design should derive directly from its purpose

simplicity and clarity of forms and elimination of ""unnecessary detail""

materials at 90 degrees to each other

visual expression of structure (as opposed to the hiding of structural elements)

the related concept of ""Truth to materials"", meaning that the true nature or natural appearance of a material ought to be seen rather than concealed or altered to represent something else
use of industrially-produced materials; adoption of the machine aesthetic

particularly in International Style modernism, a visual emphasis on horizontal and vertical lines",ISC DESIGN ARCHITECTS Australia

The IBM 5100 was the first portable computer. . Here its shown powered on, and attached to an external monitor. Although weighing 55 pounds, it was much lighter and portable than previous computers.

The Xerox Note Taker was a bit more portable, and its keyboard folded out to reveal its screen. It employed what was then highly advanced technology, including 256 kB of RAM, and a 5 MHz Intel CPU.

Launched in April 1981. The Osborne 1 is recognized as the first laptop computer. It was the first commercially successful portable computer. Costing 18 hundred dollars, weighing 25 pounds, and shipping with a large bundle of software.

Later that year, Epson released a tiny battery powered portable computer, that traded screen size for convenience. It was hailed by BusinessWeek magazine as the, fourth revolution in personal computing.

The Grid Compass was the first portable computer that resembled our current laptops. Because of its high price and specialized application. It was mostly used by the US government. NASA used it on the Space Shuttle during the early 1980s, as it was both powerful and lightweight. And the special forces used them for their ruggedness, and use of solid state memory.

The TRS-80, sold through Radio Shack, was popular with journalists. They could type about 11 pages of text, and then transmit it for editing, using the built-in modem.

In 1984 the Commodore SX-64, was the first portable computer to feature a full-color display screen. It weighed about 20 pounds and sold for $995. It shipped with 64 kB of RAM and a 1 Mhz CPU. It did not sell particularly well, but became popular with user groups, and software developers. They could quickly pack, and unpack the machine, to use for copying software, or giving demonstrations.

The IBM PC Convertible, was the first laptop to use the 3¬Ω-inch floppy disk format. Which went on to become the industry standard. Like modern laptops, it featured power management. And the ability to run from batteries.

After the failure of their first laptop, Apple re-worked their concept, and released the PowerBook line in October 1991. They immediately caused a stir in the industry, with their dark grey cases, and the positioning of their pointing device.

In 1992, Olivetti developed and released the first laptop featuring a touchpad. The position near the base of the screen was the norm, as most applications were text based, and did not require a pointing device.

That same year, Olivetti released a smaller laptop. The Quadderno. Capable of audio recording, while the computer was off. And almost instant boot up. It shipped with a 16 Mhz CPU, 1MB of RAM, and 20MB of hard disk space.

The Concerto was the first convertible laptop. It had a detachable keyboard, pen, and touch screen. But the touch screen only worked with the special pen. Like today's tablets, most of the electronics, were housed with the screen. This laptop was definitely ahead of its time!

The TC11 hundred had a very unique design. It was a hybrid laptop which included a touch-screen, Stylus, and tablet mode. Unfortunately, Windows XP was not a touch friendly OS, hampering its success. Like the Concerto, this was another laptop that was ahead of its time.

ASUS released the 7 0 1 in October 2007, which was the first netbook on the market. It featured a 7 inch screen, an Intel Celeron-M processor, and a 4 gigabyte hard disk.

The Yoga 13 was one of the first modern hybrid laptops, taking advantage, of Windows 8 touch interface. The name Yoga, is a reference to the units design, which allows four different configurations.

The Razer Blade was the first true portable gaming laptop. At .9 inches thin, and weighing 6.5 pounds, the Blade Pro was the most portable 17-inch gaming laptop in its class.

The Yoga Book hybrid laptop, brought even more functionality in 2016. By using a digitizer panel as the keyboard, the user was able to draw, write, and type on the same panel. The trade-off was, the lack of haptic feel and feedback, when in keyboard mode.

The 2018 version of the Yoga Book now uses e-ink for the keyboard panel. e-Ink allows for a more natural drawing surface, and for custom input entry layouts, depending on the application being used. And most importantly, it allows for reading, without wasting any battery, or having to carry a second device.

Asus is currently working on Project PreCog, which consists of a dual monitor laptop, similar to the Yoga Book, but without the limitations of e-Ink. Both could be used as monitors, by connecting an external keyboard. Or both monitors can be used for gaming, or for presentations. In laptop mode, one monitor is used normally, while the other is used as the keyboard, or control panel.

So today, we‚Äôre going to take a look at computing‚Äôs origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we‚Äôve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life.

But what ARE computers and how do they work? Puppet Topher meets his friend Ulka, a computer programmer, who explains to kids how computers work.  This is a basic Intro to Computers and Programming for Kids - if you like this video, let us know and we'll make more videos on this topic! 

In this video, you'll learn about the difference between Hardware and Software, and how to write very good computer programs by giving careful instructions.  Topher writes his first computer program - How to make a Peanut Butter Sandwich.  It's not quite as easy as he thinks it will be!

ReVeUvwTGdU,computers,youtube#video,2018-07-24T17:00:13.000Z,UCDrekHmOnkptxq3gUU0IyfA,3 years of Computer Science in 8 minutes,"This is the most asked question on my channel by far so I thought I'd explain how I learned programming. In the process I got a little distracted and accidentally explained all of computer science in 8 minutes (kind of). 

The goal of this video was to show you the connections between modern day (high-level) programming and how it was implemented at the low level. I show you the basics in Java and convert it to C code, then into Assembly, which leads me to talk about how computers perform addition/subtraction, and the logic design behind that is all implemented with transistors. In case you couldn't tell, I love low level programming. Just a disclaimer that I'm not saying this is the best way to learn programming I am simply sharing what I feel was the most valuable in my learning so far. I know many people start with web technologies which can be a great introduction as well! I am currently teaching myself a lot of server networking & all that stuff. I just believe if you really want to understand how to design algorithms and solve problems in creative ways then the most valuable things you can learn are at the low level. Even though C is 40 years old it is still regarded as producing the most efficient code since you have full control over pointers and memory management with minimal overhead. (the only thing faster is assembly.. an even lower level)

A FEW IMPORTANT NOTES:
1: At the end I said cooling is not required. I went off script here, I meant to say ""additional cooling"". Any fans your CPU or case comes with are most certainly required.
2: A GPU is technically a component within the Graphics card (CPU is to Computer as GPU is to Graphics card) but if you're thinking about building a computer the terms are used interchangably. Every graphics card comes with a GPU inside of it and they are often referred to as GPU because that is the defining characteristic of a graphics card.
3: Solid State Drives are the same thing as hard drives, just with less space and faster speed due to the lack of spinning disks.
4: A GPU is technically not an *essential* part of a computer. You can boot without it. But to do almost anything desktop computers are good for, you will need a grahpics card.

SUMMARY:
- Opening new tabs is an action that you do countless times during the day. Instead of doing it manually with your mouse, you can simply press ‚Äúctrl‚Äù and the letter T and a new tab will open.
- You can type your problem into the Google search bar and read what Microsoft or the various tech forums have to tell you.
- If you‚Äôre traveling abroad and you need to see how much money you will get with the exchange, you can simply write down the amount of money and the currencies of the country where you‚Äôre traveling.
- When your laptop is on airplane mode it means that many features, like your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, are disabled. This takes some pressure off your battery and allows it to charge faster than if operating normally.
- You can simply push ‚Äúalt‚Äù and then left click on an image and it will be automatically saved on your computer in your Downloads folder. 
- There are various ways that can hide your IP address and make your browsing invisible. You need to install a good VPN on your internet browser so that it changes your real location.
- Most computers have the night shift mode, which adjusts the brightness during the night.
- If you are having problems with your computer‚Äôs speed, it might be the fact that your desktop is full of icons. Instead of having a folder for every little thing on your desktop, you can create one folder and organize everything in there.
- If you don‚Äôt just want to change your password, but also find out who the thief (or thieves) are, then you can download Who Is on My Wi-Fi and maybe go confront them.
- Deleting files and then emptying the recycling bin can prove to be very frustrating. What you can do is download Recuva, which is the top program to recover permanently deleted files.
-Millions of people get hacked every day and you might be one of them at some point. Seeing your antivirus being turned off is one of the first serious signs.
- Another tremendously useful shortcut is the one that exits your web browser. In this case, you press ‚Äúctrl‚Äù and then the letter Q.
- When combining the ‚Äúctrl‚Äù key and the letter I there are various things that can happen in a total of 147 different programs. However, the most ordinary and common use of the combo is to turn text in Word and other text editing programs from normal style into italics.

Buying a new computer is something that typically requires a lot of thought, because there is so much to consider. How much RAM to get, what kind of CPU, should you build it or buy it off the shelf? This video covers pretty much every possibility for what to look for. This includes the specs of the computer of course, but also what to look for in each hardware component, such as the CPU, Graphics card, RAM, Storage SSD or HDD, and even optical disc drives.

Computers slow down for several reasons which we'll go into in this video. Some obvious reasons include lots of startup programs which end up running in the background. But there are some less obvious reasons such as dust on the inside of the PC case, and reducing thermal performance. We'll also go over tips to remedy all these issues and get your PC running, and avoid it slowing down in the future.

Fortunately, none of these materially affect the content of the video!

[0:30-5:33] - Starting off we'll look at, the origins of computing from as far back as 3000 BC with the abacus and progressing to discuss some of the first mechanical computers. After this, we'll get to see the first signs of modern computing emerge, through the use of electromechanical relays in computers along with punched cards for data I/O.

[5:33-8:36] - Following that we'll discuss, the 1st generation of modern computing, the vacuum tube era. The first technology that was fully digital and resembled how modern computers operate.

[8:36-10:49] - Afterwards we'll discuss, the 2nd generation of modern computing, the transistor era. The transistor miniaturized the vacuum tube and was much more efficient in terms of speed, power consumption, heat and more. It is the core technology behind how all computers operate today. 

[10:49-13:04] - To conclude we'll discuss, the 3rd generation of modern computing, the integrated circuit era. The integrated circuit was able to pack many transistors onto a single chip and is behind the exponential growth of modern technology.

Francis celebrated a solemn Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica for thousands of people as hundreds of others watched on large screens outside.

As is customary on Christmas Eve, the 83-year-old pope weaved his sermon around the spiritual and personal significance of the night that Jesus was born in Bethlehem.

""Christmas reminds us that God continues to love us all, even the worst of us,"" Francis, presiding at the seventh Christmas season of his pontificate, said in his sermon.

Without mentioning them specifically, Francis also referred to recent Church troubles, including its attempts to come to grips with continuing sexual abuse scandals around the world and financial irregularities closer to home at the Vatican.

In his latest attempt to confront a sexual abuse scandal, Francis last week announced sweeping changes to the way the Church deals with them, abolishing the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" that previously covered them.

Advocates for the victims of a scandal that has rocked the Church for nearly two decades applauded the move.

On Christmas Day, Francis will deliver his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message and blessing from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to thousands of people in the square below.

Unlike that on Christmas Eve, the Christmas day message is typically more about the significance of the Christmas message amidst the wars and conflicts of contemporary society.

But the Catholic Pope isn't new to being at the center of controversies with the Catholic church.

Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1936 - Catholic Pope Francis was the son of Italian immigrants who fled the fascist dictatorship of Benito Mussolini. Bergoglio dedicated his life to the Roman Catholic church in 1958 when he joined the novitiate of the Society of Jesus.

Fast forward to March 13, 2013 -- a billow of white smoke rose above the Sistine Chapel. That was the moment Jorge Mario Bergoglio, became known as Pope Francis. Pope Francis became the 266th leader of the Roman Catholic church.   

His leadership would bring in a new wave of firsts for the Vatican. Pope Francis was the first pope from Latin America, the first Jesuit, and first non-European in over 1,000 years.

He said he wanted to shift the church's priority to helping the poor and marginalized. Pope Francis was seen as a reformer, someone who wanted to push the Catholic church forward.  

He's made relatively supportive comments about the LGBTQ community in 2013, saying quote ""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" 

He's warned of the growing dangers of climate change, argued that the death penalty is ""inadmissible,"" and gave priests the right to ""forgive abortions,"" a medical procedure that would have automatically resulted in the excommunication from the church.

But these signs of change didn't sit well with some conservatives in the church.

In today's episode, we're going to explore some of the controversies of Pope Francis' past, and the recent allegations that might leave some to ask, will pope Francis resign?

Iranian state TV said it was in revenge for the U.S. killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, whose death last week in an American drone strike near Baghdad prompted angry calls to avenge his slaying.

Soleimani's killing and the strikes by Iran came as tensions have been rising steadily across the Mideast after President Donald Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. They also marked the first time in recent years that Washington and Tehran have attacked each other directly rather than through proxies in the region. It raised the chances of open conflict erupting between the two enemies, which have been at odds since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Iran initially announced only one strike, but U.S. officials confirmed both. There was no immediate word on injuries. U.S. defense officials were at the White House, likely to discuss options with Trump, who launched the strike on Soleimani while facing an upcoming impeachment trial in the Senate,",NBC New York

British forces were in the coalition military bases in Iraq that were hit by Iranian missiles overnight, UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab has confirmed.

Iran fired about 15 missiles from within its territory at the Ayn al Asad air base and another facility in Erbil at 1.30am local time (10.30pm UK time).

Both bases host coalition forces, including forces from the UK, although the Ministry of Defence in London subsequently said there have been no British casualties.

Mr Raab urged Iran to pursue ""urgent de-escalation"" as the crisis in the Gulf intensified rather than carry out what he labelled as ""reckless and dangerous attacks"".

‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì
READ MORE: Security forces at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad fired tear gas Tuesday in response to protesters who breached the outer edge of the compound as they rallied in condemnation of U.S. airstrikes targeting an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq and Syria.

Some of the thousands of protesters set small fires, threw stones and waved flags in support of militia groups.

The Sunday strikes have sparked anger and criticism by top Iraqi officials, but the United States is defending its actions and warning it could strike again.

President Donald Trump put the blame on Iran for the breaching of the U.S. embassy compound.

The U.S. airstrikes targeting Kataeb Hezbollah weapons storage facilities and command and control locations across Iraq and eastern Syria killed at least 25 people and injured dozens more.

U.S. officials said the strikes were in response to a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base on Friday that killed a U.S. defense contractor. Officials said the evidence left no doubt Kataeb Hezbollah was responsible.

Kataeb Hezbollah, part of the state-sanctioned militias operating in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), has denied responsibility for the Friday attack that killed the U.S. contractor. But it warned a response would be forthcoming.

Since May, the United States has sent an additional 14,000 forces to the Middle East, along with air and missile defense systems and additional reconnaissance capabilities, in response to what officials see as a growing threat from Iran and its proxies.

U.S. officials also warned they planned to hit Iran with additional economic sanctions in the coming year, saying, ""Iran's economic problems and challenges are going to compound in 2020,"" an official said.

READ MORE:  U.S. President Donald Trump, Friday, January 3, celebrated the death of the commander of Iran's elite Quds Force, saying the airstrike that killed the shadowy Qassem Soleimani was long overdue. 
 
Speaking publicly for the first time since defense officials confirmed Soleimani was the target of a U.S. strike near Baghdad International Airport early Friday, Trump also warned Iran that it risked more strikes if it continued to target Americans. 
 
""We took action last night to stop a war,"" Trump told reporters at his home in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. ""However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors, must end and it must end now.""

READ MORE: An Iran-backed militia threatened revenge Monday in response to U.S. airstrikes against its positions in Iraq and Syria, which killed at least 25 people.
 
The warning from Kataeb Hezbollah came as Iran's foreign minister condemned the U.S. attacks as violating Iraqi sovereignty and amounting to an act of terrorism.
 
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the airstrikes in comments to reporters late Sunday. He said U.S. fighter jets hit three Kataeb Hezbollah targets in western Iraq and two others in eastern Syria.
 
Esper identified the targets as weapons storage and command and control facilities.
 
The airstrikes were carried out in response to a rocket attack Friday on an Iraqi military base in northern Iraq that killed a U.S. defense contractor.

‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì

READ MORE: U.S. President Donald Trump is publicly voicing suspicion that Iran may have accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner.

‚ÄúSomebody could have made a mistake on the other side,‚Äù said Trump of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. ‚ÄúSome people say it was mechanical. Personally, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs even a question.‚Äù  

Iranian officials have maintained the Boeing 737-800, at an altitude of 2,400 meters, suffered a catastrophic engine failure early Wednesday (local time). All 176 people on board the plane bound for Kyiv died, including 63 Canadians.

But government sources tell VOA that U.S. officials have examined satellite data and imagery leading them to believe the airliner, just after taking off from Tehran, was hit by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile after being targeted accidentally.

‚ÄúAt some point they‚Äôll release the black box. Ideally, they‚Äôll get it to Boeing‚Äù [the U.S. company that built the 737-800 airliner], added Trump in remarks to reporters in the White House Roosevelt Room on Thursday.

Video of the aircraft shows it breaking up in the air in a fireball over Iran.

The crash occurred hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers in response to last week's U.S. drone attack that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani.

The head of Iran's of Civil Aviation Organization denies the plane could have been hit by a missile.

‚ÄúScientifically, it is impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane and such rumors are illogical,"" ISNA quoted Ali Abedzadeh as saying.

The governments of Ukraine and Canada are not accepting the initial assessment by Iran that the cause of the crash appeared to be a mechanical issue.

Canada‚Äôs foreign affairs minister, Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne, told his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, that many questions will need to be answered, according to the ministry in Ottawa.

Investigators in Iran said the voice and data recorders from the Boeing 737 aircraft, built in 2016, were recovered from the crash site, a swathe of farmland on the outskirts of the Iranian capital, but that the so-called ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù were damaged and some data had been lost.

‚ÄúI hope the Iranians will work with us and provide us with the black box,‚Äù U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, said on MSNBC, calling for the Trump administration to grant exemptions to the sanctions law so Boeing investigators from the United States could travel to Iran to cooperate with investigators there.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board typically participates in investigations of overseas air crashes when a U.S. airline or plane manufacturer is involved. But given the heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran, and the fact that the two sides have no diplomatic relations, it is uncertain whether the NTSB or Boeing would be involved in the investigation of the UIA crash.

In a statement sent to VOA‚Äôs Ukrainian Service, the NTSB said it was ‚Äúmonitoring developments surrounding the crash of UIA flight 752‚Äù and was ‚Äúfollowing its standard procedures‚Äù for international aviation accident investigations.

‚ÄúAs part of its usual procedures, the NTSB is working with the State Department and other agencies to determine the best course of action,‚Äù it said.

""The U.S. has not participated in an accident investigation in Iran since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. So, it is very unlikely that the NTSB will be involved,‚Äù said Madhu Unnikrishnan, editor of U.S. airline news service Skift Airline Weekly in a VOA Ukrainian Service interview.

The Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which Iran is a signatory, does not require Tehran to hand over the data recorders to the NTSB or Boeing, Andriy Guck, a Ukraine-based attorney and aviation expert, said.

‚ÄúThere is a duty to investigate,‚Äù Guck told VOA‚Äôs Ukrainian Service in a phone conversation. ‚ÄúIran can decide to investigate the black boxes by itself or transfer them to a foreign laboratory. But if the Iranians do not allow anyone else to participate in the examination of the boxes, it will raise doubts about their investigation.‚Äù

UIA President Yevhen Dykhne said, ‚ÄúIt was one of the best planes we had, with an amazing, reliable crew.‚Äù

Video of the aircraft shows it breaking up midair in a fireball over Iran.

The crash early Wednesday occurred hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers in response to last week's U.S. drone attack that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani.

The governments of Ukraine and Canada are not accepting the initial assessment by Iran that the cause of the crash appeared to be a mechanical issue.

Citing what he called ‚Äúintelligence from multiple sources,‚Äù Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference on Thursday that ‚Äúthe intelligence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.‚Äù

Trudeau added, ‚ÄúThis may well have been unintentional.‚Äù

Following a phone call Thursday between British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Downing Street said there needs to be ‚Äúa full credible and transparent investigation in what happened.‚Äù But British officials added that they did not think the downing of the jet was intentional.  

The global security risk company IHS Markit issued a briefing Thursday claiming that the UAL flight was hit by an SA-15 missile fired by a unit of Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, who was attending a U.N. Security Council meeting in New York Thursday, said his government has sent a team of experts who are on the ground in Iran, working with their Iranian counterparts to sift through the crash debris for evidence of the cause.

Investigators in Iran said the voice and data recorders from the Boeing 737 aircraft, built in 2016, were recovered from the crash site, a swathe of farmland on the outskirts of the Iranian capital, but that the so-called ""black boxes"" were damaged and some data had been lost.

Sixty-three Canadians died on the Ukraine International Airlines jet that crashed early Wednesday near Tehran, one of the worst aviation disasters ever to affect Canada. Some may have had dual nationality, given the large Iranian population in north Toronto and other parts of the country. There were also 82 Iranians on the flight and 11 Ukrainians, including the nine crew members, among other nationalities, Ukraine‚Äôs foreign ministry said.

Of the 167 passengers, 123 were born in 1981 or later, putting them in the category of millennial generation or younger. At least 11 victims were under 10 and the youngest was born in 2018, according to a list of passengers published on Ukraine International‚Äôs website.

It‚Äôs still unclear what caused Flight 752 to plunge from the sky shortly after taking off for Kyiv, killing all on board. Iranian authorities initially said ‚Äútechnical‚Äù causes brought down the Boeing Co. 737-800, then blamed an engine fire. The Ukrainian embassy in Tehran ruled out terrorism but amended its statement to offer no comment on possible causes. Ukraine International said it didn‚Äôt ‚Äúeven consider‚Äù crew error as a possible factor.

‚ÄúOur government will continue to work closely with its international partners to ensure that this crash is thoroughly investigated and that Canadians‚Äô questions are answered,‚Äù Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement Wednesday. ‚ÄúWe also join with the other countries who are mourning the loss of citizens.‚Äù

Canada‚Äôs 2016 census showed 210,405 people identifying as at least part Iranian. While the largest concentration is in north Toronto, often referred to as Tehran to by the Persian community, the diaspora stretches across the country. A large number of the victims were from Edmonton, Alberta.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a very heavy week for us with all the events that have taken place since the start of the new year,‚Äù Sara Alimardani, president of the Iranian Women‚Äôs Organization of Ontario said in an email. ‚ÄúMany people right now are unsure of what can happen next with Iran and are likely making arrangements to leave the country, if they can.‚Äù

Canada suspended diplomatic relations with Iran in 2012 and closed its Tehran embassy. There are no direct flights between Iran and Canada which is likely why the Canadian passengers on the Ukraine International flight were returning home via Kyiv. The airline is also known to offer affordable flights.

A number of passengers on the downed plane booked their travel through Atlas Travel & Holidays Inc., an agency located in the area of Toronto with a large Iranian population. ‚ÄúEverybody is canceling their flights because they are not comfortable to go, especially with a Ukraine airline,‚Äù said Ben Mehdizadeh, director of operations for the travel agency. ‚ÄúIt is sad of course.‚Äù

The Toronto area is home to about 100,000 Iranians, most of whom arrived after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, although the community‚Äôs roots go back several generations, according to Javad Moghimi Parsa, an Iranian-trained photographer who documents the community around the world.

In a 2016 article about ‚ÄúTehran to‚Äù he described what it‚Äôs like to walk through Richmond Hill, part of the Greater Toronto Area. ‚ÄúYou can feel the essence of the Persian community,‚Äù he wrote, noting the prevalence of Farsi on signs and spoken on the street.

About 12% of Canada‚Äôs post-secondary school population is made up of international students and at least three of the city‚Äôs universities have Iranian student associations. 

The Iranian community stretches across the country. According to a tweet from Payman Parseyan, the former president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton, 27 of the victims lived in Edmonton.

The timing of the crash, which coincided with Iranian strikes against U.S. bases in Iraq, sparked speculation the jet could have been downed by Tehran‚Äôs own air defense system. Iran‚Äôs Disaster Mitigation and Management Organization said early assessments indicate the cause was a technical issue; the transport ministry initially suggested an engine fire was to blame.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
READ MORE: Speaking in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, Trudeau said 138 passengers on the flight were connecting to Canada.

The flight included many international students who were studying at universities across Canada. Newlyweds and a Canadian family of four were also on the flight.
             
Trudeau also said Wednesday his foreign minister is in touch with the government of Ukraine and his transport minister is reaching out to his international counterparts.

Getting answers from Iran might prove difficult as Canada closed its embassy in Iran in 2012 and suspended diplomatic relations.

Trudeau also said Canada condemned the missile attacks launched by Iran on two Iraqi air bases housing U.S. troops. The crash of the Ukraine International Airlines plane came hours after Iran launched the ballistic missile attack, but Iranian officials said they suspected a mechanical issue brought down the 3-year-old Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Ukrainian officials initially agreed, but later backed away and declined to offer a cause while the investigation is ongoing. (AP)

üëâ  Iranian investigators said Thursday the crew of a Ukrainian passenger jet that crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran‚Äôs airport had tried to turn back, and that the pilot made no radio communications about any problems.
The initial report from Iran‚Äôs Civil Aviation Organization also cited witnesses on the ground and in a passing aircraft as saying the Ukraine International Airlines plane was on fire before it hit the ground.
 Zelenskiy declared Thursday a day of mourning for the 167 passengers and nine crew members who died when the plane bound for Kyiv crashed early Wednesday.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said the dead included 82 Iranians and 63 Canadians along with Ukrainians, Swedes, Afghans, Germans and Britons.

wvdo1rBWu00,ukraine,youtube#video,2020-01-09T17:46:13.000Z,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,Trump ‚ÄòSuspicious‚Äô of Ukraine Jet Crash; U.S. &#39;Confident&#39; Iran Mistakenly Shot It Down,"U.S. intelligence officials increasingly believe that the Ukrainian jet that fell from the sky after taking off from Tehran on Wednesday was shot down by a missile, according to two people familiar with the evidence.

Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 plunged from the sky minutes after a pre-dawn takeoff, killing all 176 people aboard. The Boeing Co. 737-800 was on fire as it plunged, according to witnesses on the ground and in other aircraft, according to a preliminary Iranian report on the crash.

The U.S. government has obtained evidence indicating that the rapid descent was not the result of a mechanical issue on the plane or errors by the pilots, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing intelligence reports.

Boeing rose as much as 3% and traded up 2.4% to $339.34 at 12:21 p.m. in New York on the news, previously reported by Newsweek and CBS citing sources they didn‚Äôt identify. If the plane was brought down by a missile strike it would relieve concerns of a mechanical failure that could affect other Boeing planes.

Hassan Rezaeifar, head of an Iranian joint investigation commission on the crash, denied that evidence of a missile strike had been found, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.

The intelligence assessment is consistent with what aviation accident experts have said. The apparent rapid spread of the fire combined with the sudden halt of radio transmissions from the plane after a normal climb aren‚Äôt consistent with previous crashes, said Jeffrey Guzzetti, the former head of accident investigations at the Federal Aviation Administration.

While Iranian officials initially said they suspected a problem with one of the plane‚Äôs engines, they retracted that in a preliminary report issued Thursday. The government also took the unusual step of setting up an investigative group to examine whether ‚Äúany unlawful actions‚Äù initiated the fire on the plane, the preliminary report said.

The U.K. called for a full investigation into the crash.

‚ÄúThere needs to be a full, credible and transparent investigation into what happened. We want to see that happen as soon as possible,‚Äù Jamie Davies, spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, told reporters in London. ‚ÄúReports we‚Äôve seen are extremely concerning and we‚Äôre looking into them.‚Äù

Johnson spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday and expressed his condolences, Davies said. ‚ÄúThe prime minister offered support and will be working with Ukraine on how best to support them.‚Äù

U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters in Washington on Thursday, said ‚ÄúI have my suspicions‚Äù about why the plane went down but said he didn‚Äôt want to say what those suspicions are.

‚ÄúIt was flying in a pretty rough neighborhood,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúSomebody could have made a mistake.‚Äù

At 2:03 the Minsk II agreement refers to the separatist enclaves as ""certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine"" not the DPR and LPR.

The present conflict in Ukraine started in 2014. Today, there are 100,000 fighters stationed in the country, making it one of the most heavily militarized regions in the world. In Ukraine's east, Ukrainian forces are engaged in a struggle with Russian-backed separatists. 

A ceasefire was called in 2015, with a security zone established that was meant to foster peace. However, today the security zone remains one of the most violent places in the Ukraine. With over 10,000 deaths to date, and over 1.5 million civilians displaced, the cost of ignoring the ceasefire continues to mount by the day. And both sides are still building up their forces.

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

But Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his intelligence services have evidence an Iranian surface-to-air missile was responsible.
Video posted by the New York Times newspaper appears to show the moment a missile hit the plane near Tehran's airport.
The plane came down after Iran launched missiles at military bases in Iraq where US forces were stationed.
Iranian officials are resisting pressure for them to hand over the plane's black box recorder over to Boeing and says it will conduct an internal investigation.
Tehran says the allegations against them are ""psychological warfare"" as US-Iran ties remain fraught.

The U.S. has provided financial support to Ukraine, but not soldiers. And although there is no U.S. troop presence anywhere near the fight, some American citizens have elected to join the battle on their own. Special correspondent Simon Ostrovsky shares one such story.

The footage verified by ABC News emerged as U.S. officials said Thursday it was ""highly likely"" that an Iranian anti-aircraft missile downed a Ukrainian jetliner late Tuesday, killing all 176 people on board. They suggested it could well have been a mistake.

How will face to face negotiations change the fate of those living in conflict?

Battle lines are being redrawn ahead of peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, in an effort championed by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to tamp down hostilities in a conflict that has taken more than 13,000 lives. Since the start of the war, America has assisted Ukraine in its battle with its much more powerful neighbour, but this summer, as Trump associates pressured Ukraine to open an investigation into the son of Trump's political rival Joe Biden, the White House considered withholding its military aid.  This news is worrying for Ukrainians, as their ability to negotiate with the Russians partly depends on the United States and other international support. ""It's obvious that there will be no agreement"", says Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Ukrainian officer Oleh has low expectations as well: ""This isn't the first ceasefire, and I can't recall an instance where a ceasefire ended in peace"", he says. Despite such pessimistic outlooks on the negotiations, the Ukrainian President is confident that these peace talks will be productive. ""This meeting is already a victory for us"", he says.
